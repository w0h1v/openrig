# Integration scenarios

The first PR automation increment is described in [ci/README.md](ci/README.md).
It runs the existing daemon-restart baton fixture plus a fault control in the
installed-package testbed, now alongside the library's queue-baton scenario and
its explicit seed binding. Hosted green/red execution is required before claiming
either verified. The eleven authored scenarios below are a broader target;
they are not eleven admitted CI passes.

## Historical 51-03 seed contract — the ten (+ one)

Compose-only L2 scenario set for the OpenRig containerized test system (mission
release-0.5.1). Each scenario pins a NAMED defect class from the 0.4.8/0.5.0 marathon
and becomes standing infrastructure instead of a hand-built probe.

## Authoring authority (verified at authoring time)
- 51-03 spec: README `99f35af5c2d854a7` / PRD `aa0638f161cc3b82` (hash-verified).
- **Format is the LOCKED 51-02 spec** (README `b157f5bc68940963` / PRD `1bf3340188e39212`)
  and the BINDING arch shape `ARCH-SHAPE-scenario-format-and-runner` sha256
  `fc30a736c104863a…`. The daemon-lifecycle step verb for #11 is arch-ruled in
  `ARCH-RULING-51-09-host-identity-and-51-02-step-verb` (`daemon: {op: sigterm|restart}`
  on the shared env-helper's lifecycle surface).
- `emit.behavior` vocabulary = 51-01's LOCKED FOUR {compaction, slow_output,
  mid_turn_death, restore}. `usage_limit` is real-runtime-only and MUST fail validation
  loud in a stub topology — no scenario here names it.
- Assertions ride the shipped-observable surface set ONLY: `ps` · `queue` · `stream` ·
  `scope` · `proof` · `pane` · `transcript` · `tui_socket` · `policy_provenance`. No
  internal DB pokes.

## Layout
- `scenarios/*.yaml` — the eleven scenarios (§6 ten + the A1 eleventh), one file each,
  the scenario name naming its defect class.
- `fixtures/*.yaml` — topology rig specs, seats `runtime: stub`.
- `scripts/` — scenario-resolved stub scripts (per the 51-01 scripted-response
  contract); 51-01's built-in default script applies when a scenario names none.
- `ROUTING.md` — every capability this set needs that the LOCKED 51-02/51-01 build must
  land BEFORE these run. Per 51-03 mini-req 2 these are ROUTED, never shimmed here.

## The seed contract (per-scenario, binding — kills the unfalsifiable-RED risk)
Every scenario carries a `seed_regression: {class: …}` step and, in its header, a
**SEED definition**: exactly what a seeded regression of its class plants, and why the
scenario's `expect` legs MUST catch it. Acceptance per scenario = the PAIR: GREEN on the
shipped tip + RED on the seeded run whose runner diff (expected vs last-observed) names
the class. A scenario that cannot be shown RED is not delivered.

For executable seeds, place the step before the affected action and supply the
pipeline's `deps.seedRegression` controller. It must arm a real local fault in the
seeded run and explicitly record that fault as disabled in the healthy run. The
paired harness verifies the injection receipt and the specific failed observation.
The remaining historical markers after their assertions are not executable proofs.

## Run status honesty (authored before the runner exists)
YAML authoring is cleared ahead of the 51-02 runner (dispatch authority). These files
are the runner's acceptance targets; they are authored to the locked format and DO NOT
run until 51-02 lands the runner + env-helper and 51-01 lands the emit repertoire (items
5–8). Scenario #11 is RED-FIRST: its GREEN gates on the 51-06 transactional
execution-closure fix; until then its expected-RED runs are recorded as expected-RED,
never massaged. See `ROUTING.md` for the exact per-item dependencies.
