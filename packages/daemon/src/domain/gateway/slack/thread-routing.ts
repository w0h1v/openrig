// S10 — deterministic thread ROUTING over the thread↔seat map. The four enumerated classes
// (proof contract), each a pure lookup — zero inference:
//   1. NEW conversation      — outbound-only: a fresh root posts un-threaded, then the map
//                              opens (thread_ts = the posted root's ts). Inbound never mints.
//   2. EXISTING thread       — reply carries thread_ts, map hit (open) → EXACTLY the mapped seat.
//   3. CLOSED thread         — map hit (closed) → STILL exactly the mapped seat (closure is
//                              conversation state, never a routing black hole).
//   4. UNMAPPED / human-initiated — thread_ts with no mapping, or a top-level channel message
//                              (no thread_ts): the ORCHESTRATOR's unrouted-signal row — the
//                              configured inbound destination with the unrouted-signal tag.
//                              Never dropped, never guessed at a seat.
