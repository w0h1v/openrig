// OPR.0.5.5.19 — THE FORMAL ACTIVITY TAXONOMY: the declared state language every surface
// renders from (TUI, `rig ps`, node-inventory). Three orthogonal axes plus derived
// diagnoses, ratified at product/from-openrig.dev/taxonomy-agent-state-ADDENDUM-2026-08-26.md
// (founder ruling 22:00Z); reconciliation vs herdr/omnigent lives in
// docs/reference/agent-state-taxonomy.md — the doc CITES the addendum, never forks it.
//
// BINDING EXCLUSIONS (SPEC mini-req 1, adversarially held — verdict 1229a4b7):
//  - attention and needs-input are NEVER values of the activity enum. needs-input rides
//    as a count + short reason phrase (the omnigent pending_elicitations_count +
//    blocked_on shape); attention stays in its own machinery (attentionCount).
//  - UNKNOWN is a first-class honest value — the oracle saying "cannot tell", never an
//    error and never a guess. Unknown beats a confident wrong answer.
//  - Derived diagnoses (PARKED, HELD-is-not-parked, DONE-UNSEEN) are computed at read
//    time from the axes + the queue's obligation face; they are never stored as states.
//
// The addendum's human-facing activity list shows four values (working / idle /
// needs-input / unknown). The typed enum carries THREE: needs-input is derived for
// display from the count+reason fields via `deriveDisplayActivity` — the one bridge —
// so no store or transition ever holds "needs-input" as a state. That reconciliation
// is documented in the reference doc's addendum-mapping section.
