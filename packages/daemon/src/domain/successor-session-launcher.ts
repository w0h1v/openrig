/**
 * OPR.0.4.3.04 — the explicit successor-creation seam for the seat-handover
 * full-cycle composer (IMPL-SPEC §2.1b; resolves the rev1-dual BLOCKING B1).
 *
 * It creates an UNMANAGED, discoverable tmux successor for a non-discovered
 * handover source (fresh), routes it through REAL runtime startup so it becomes
 * a LIVE, READY agent (not a bare shell), records it as an ACTIVE discovery
 * candidate, and returns that candidate + the captured launch resume token so
 * the composer can route it through the EXISTING discovered->commit rebind path.
 * It deliberately does NOT `registerClaimedSession`/`upsertBinding` — the
 * session stays unmanaged until the handover `commit` claims it, so the
 * departing seat's binding is never touched before successor readiness.
 *
 * B1 (rev1-dual fix): the successor is launched through the runtime adapter's
 * `launchHarness` + readiness poll — the SAME startup/readiness primitives
 * `StartupOrchestrator` drives — WITHOUT the ahead-of-commit managed-session
 * registration those `StartupOrchestrator.startNode` bookkeeping steps would
 * require (updateStartupStatus / node_startup_context / updateResumeToken by
 * sessionId all need a registered session row). Driving the adapter primitives
 * directly is how we make the successor a live agent while keeping it unmanaged
 * until commit. Any launch/readiness failure UNWINDS the created session and
 * leaves the original binding intact (commit never runs).
 *
 * Why not `NodeLauncher.launchNode`: it refuses a bound node and, on success,
 * registers a managed session + binding in the same transaction — which would
 * trip `successor_already_managed` in the commit path. This seam creates a
 * DISTINCT unmanaged session instead.
