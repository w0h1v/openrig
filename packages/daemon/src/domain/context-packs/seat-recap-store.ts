// OPR.0.5.3.5 mini-req 7 (Q2 + Q2-Amendment 1) — the seat recap store.
//
// The AUTHORED recap: decisions-with-rationale written by the outgoing occupant
// at the boundary, extending the shipped from-record boot recap's name (the Q2
// unify-what-exists ruling — predecessor-recap-resolver.ts remains the
// transcript-derived sibling). SEAT-HOMED beside LEARNED (Q2-Amendment 1(a):
// the recap is POSITION knowledge, unshareable by construction — a
// library-homed recap would be position knowledge on the portable shelf).
// RETENTION (1(b)): superseded-chain versioning — the newest recap is
// RECAP.md, predecessors stay byte-preserved under recap-superseded/ in the
// seat directory, cleaned by seat-directory lifecycle, NEVER by library
// curation; no librarian job is created.
//
// Two validation altitudes, deliberately different:
// - ADDRESSABILITY is the one HARD gate on write: the recap is composed by
//   address (seat:RECAP.md#...), so an unaddressable recap (duplicate header
//   paths, unterminated fence) would fail every handover profile downstream,
//   silently late. Structural, not prose-shaped.
// - The AUTHORING CONTRACT validates ADVISORY on its CHECKABLE subset only:
//   findings flag for review, never gate the boundary (the D2 pattern). The
//   contract's semantic halves (temporal order, derived-values-as-commands)
//   are not mechanically checkable and are NOT pretended at.
