 * 5b82324b — the STRUCTURAL activity cache. Sibling of SeatActivityService (which reads ONLY the tmux

 * running tmux seat per tick and classifies it STRUCTURALLY via classifyPaneActivity (spinner shapes,
 * `esc to interrupt`, idle-prompt / status-bar signatures — never a verb allowlist, so a "Drizzling"-
 * style spinner reads as motion instead of a false park). The cache is READ (capture-FREE) by
 * attachAgentActivity so the `rig ps` ACTIVITY column reflects real pane motion for hook-less / stale-
 * hook / turn-boundary seats WITHOUT reintroducing the per-request capture storm the healthz-wedge
 * cheap-default removed. Two safety rules make the BACKGROUND path itself safe:
 *   (MF1) a read refuses a stale observation and a failed capture invalidates the prior row — a stale
 *         positive verdict never survives a capture outage or a same-name occupant transition; and
 *   (MF2) sweeps are SINGLE-FLIGHT and HELD until the real captures settle — a slow/stuck tmux can
 *         never accumulate overlapping whole-fleet captures (only one sweep's captures are ever in
 *         flight). We deliberately do NOT time-out a capture to release the guard: execCommand has no
 *         AbortSignal, so a wrapper timeout would release single-flight while the child process lives,
 *         letting a later sweep spawn MORE children — the storm at the process level. A permanently
 *         stuck tmux therefore degrades to "no structural signal" (honest, via MF1 age-expiry), never
 *         a storm. A kill-backed capture primitive (bounded abort) is a tmux-adapter follow-on.
