/**
 * Bundle skills router (Item 6 / slice-05 Checkpoint 7.2).
 *
 * Pure function. Copies skill files declared in a bundle manifest's skills[]
 * block from the bundle's extracted tree to the operator skills library.
 * No daemon dependencies — fully unit-testable via FsOps injection.
 *
 * Safety: each declared skill path is treated as untrusted manifest content;
 * the helper rejects paths that escape the bundle tree (path containment
 * check mirrors the bundle-source-resolver pattern). The output target
 * directory is created via mkdirp.
 *
 * Honest-scoping: missing source files surface as warnings in the result
 * (NOT thrown errors) so the install lifecycle can continue with what's
 * available. Same for absent skills library: caller decides to skip-or-fail.
 *
 * /install handler integration lands at Checkpoint 7.3.
