# RigSpec Reference

Version: 0.2 (pod-aware)
Last validated against code: 2026-04-11
Source of truth: `packages/daemon/src/domain/rigspec-schema.ts`, `packages/daemon/src/domain/types.ts`

This is the canonical reference for the pod-aware RigSpec YAML format. Every field, validation rule, and default documented here was traced from the actual parser and validator code, not from prior documentation.

## Top-Level Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `version` | string | yes | — | Must be `"0.2"` for pod-aware specs. |
| `name` | string | yes | — | Rig name. Used in session naming (`{pod}-{member}@{name}`), snapshot identification, and spec library lookup. |
| `summary` | string | no | — | Human-readable description. Shown in spec library, review surfaces, and `rig specs show`. |
| `culture_file` | string | no | — | Relative path to a rig-wide culture/constitution file. Must be a safe relative path (no `..`, no absolute). |
| `permission_policy` | string | no | — | Permission policy attached to the rig. Either a built-in (`builtin:locked`, `builtin:standard`, `builtin:open`, `builtin:yolo`) or a safe relative path to a custom policy file (resolved from this spec's directory; no `..`, no absolute). Absent leaves the default floor. A member may set its own `permission_policy`, which takes precedence over the rig-level one. See "Attaching a permission policy" below. |
| `managed_blocks` | map | no | `CLAUDE.md` | File that receives OpenRig's managed instruction blocks for Claude Code members. Only the `claude-code` key is accepted, with `CLAUDE.md` or `CLAUDE.local.md`. Codex members always use `AGENTS.md`. See "Choosing the Claude instruction file" below. |
| `docs` | Doc[] | no | — | Documentation files that should travel with the rig. Included in rig bundles. Each entry has a `path` field (safe relative path). The engine does not consume these — they are for humans and agents setting up the environment before launch. |
| `startup` | StartupBlock | no | — | Rig-level startup files and actions. Applied to all members via the startup layering model. |
| `services` | ServicesBlock | no | — | Optional managed services (Docker Compose). When present, services boot before any agent launches. |
| `pods` | Pod[] | yes | — | At least one pod required. Each pod is a bounded context containing members and pod-local edges. |
| `edges` | CrossPodEdge[] | no | `[]` | Cross-pod edges connecting members in different pods. Must use fully-qualified `pod.member` IDs. |

### Attaching a permission policy

Attach a policy to a rig with `permission_policy`, either at the rig level or on a member:

```yaml
# a built-in, by name:
permission_policy: builtin:standard

# or a custom policy file, by relative path (resolved from this spec's directory):
permission_policy: policies/my-cautious-dev.policy.md
```

Built-in policies (`locked` / `standard` / `open` / `yolo`) are read-only and are
referenced as `builtin:<name>`. A custom policy lives in your own project and is
referenced by a safe relative path (no `..`, no absolute). A shipped example of the
custom shape is `packages/daemon/policies/examples/my-cautious-dev.policy.md` — copy it
into your project and edit it to taste.

This records a selection, not a live permission change. Flag-surface policies
select launch flags; config-surface policies still need native configuration
application and inspection. In particular, `builtin:yolo` selects Codex's
`danger-full-access` sandbox and `never` approval policy, and replaces
any `codex_config_profile` argument. See [practical permission choices](getting-started.md#opt-in-permissive-operation).

An explicit `rig seat set-permissions` choice overrides member/rig policy for
future managed launches of that stable seat; it does not rewrite this spec or
its inherited policy provenance. `inherit` removes that override. See
[per-seat permission mode](getting-started.md#per-seat-permission-mode).

### Choosing the Claude instruction file

OpenRig writes its instructions for Claude Code members into managed blocks in
the member's working directory. By default the file is `CLAUDE.md`. If your
repository tracks `CLAUDE.md`, write the blocks to `CLAUDE.local.md` instead:

```yaml
managed_blocks:
  claude-code: CLAUDE.local.md
```

Claude Code loads `CLAUDE.local.md` from the working directory as well. By
convention the file is kept out of git, for example with a `.gitignore` entry.

- Accepted values are `CLAUDE.md` and `CLAUDE.local.md`. Any other value or
  runtime key is rejected before a member launches.
- The setting applies to launch, restore, relaunch, handover, adding members,
  and export. `rig down` removes OpenRig's blocks from the selected file only.
- OpenRig never edits, moves or deletes blocks in the other file.

A rig that already wrote blocks into `CLAUDE.md` keeps them there after you
switch. Until you remove them, `CLAUDE.md` stays modified and Claude Code loads
both copies. Delete each `<!-- BEGIN OpenRig MANAGED BLOCK: … -->` …
`<!-- END OpenRig MANAGED BLOCK: … -->` section by hand and keep the rest of the
file. If `CLAUDE.md` has no other uncommitted edits you need to keep, you can
instead run `git restore CLAUDE.md`; that command discards every unstaged change
to the file, not only OpenRig's blocks. Running `rig down` on a rig that still uses
the default is not a substitute: it strips every OpenRig block from that
directory's `CLAUDE.md`, including blocks written by other rigs.

---

## Pod

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | — | Pod identifier. Must not contain dots. Must be unique within the rig. Used as the first segment of session names and logical IDs. |
| `label` | string | yes | — | Human-readable pod name. Shown in UI explorer, graph groupings, and detail surfaces. |
| `summary` | string | no | — | Pod description. |
| `continuity_policy` | ContinuityPolicy | no | — | Pod-level continuity/restore policy. Controls compaction recovery, artifact management, and peer-driven restoration. |
| `startup` | StartupBlock | no | — | Pod-level startup files and actions. Applied to all members in this pod via the startup layering model. |
| `members` | Member[] | yes | — | At least one member required (enforced by pods needing content). |
| `edges` | PodLocalEdge[] | no | `[]` | Edges between members within this pod. Must use unqualified member IDs (not `pod.member`). |

### Pod ID Rules

- Must not contain dots (`.`)
- Must be unique across all pods in the rig
- Becomes the first segment of the qualified logical ID: `{podId}.{memberId}`
- Becomes the first segment of the canonical session name: `{podId}-{memberId}@{rigName}`

---

## Member

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | — | Member identifier. Must not contain dots. Must be unique within the pod. |
| `agent_ref` | string | yes | — | Reference to an AgentSpec. Must start with `local:` (relative) or `path:` (absolute). Exception: `builtin:terminal` for infrastructure nodes. |
| `profile` | string | yes | — | Profile name from the referenced AgentSpec. Use `default` for the default profile. Exception: `none` for terminal nodes. |
| `codex_config_profile` | string | no | — | Codex-only native profile passed as `-p <name>`; letters, numbers, `_`, `.`, `-`. Separate from the AgentSpec `profile`. With the normal launch mode, this replaces OpenRig's explicit workspace-write sandbox flag. A full-bypass policy instead emits danger-full-access and omits this profile argument. |
| `runtime` | string | yes | — | Agent runtime. Current supported values: `claude-code`, `codex`, `pi`, `omp`, `terminal`. |
| `cwd` | string | yes | — | Working directory for the agent. Resolved relative to the rig root (the directory containing the rig spec). Use `"."` for the rig root itself. Can be overridden at launch time with `rig up --cwd`. |
| `label` | string | no | — | Human-readable member name. Shown in UI when present. |
| `model` | string | no | — | Model override. Runtime-specific (e.g., `claude-opus-4-6` for Claude Code). |
| `restore_policy` | string | no | `resume_if_possible` | Restore behavior. One of: `resume_if_possible`, `relaunch_fresh`, `checkpoint_only`. |
| `startup` | StartupBlock | no | — | Member-level startup files and actions. Applied only to this member. |

### Oh My Pi (`runtime: omp`)

`runtime: omp` launches Oh My Pi through OpenRig's RPC runner. It is separate from `runtime: pi`; OMP does not use Pi's `--name` or `--approve` flags.

- **State:** Each seat uses `$OPENRIG_HOME/state/omp/<seat>/agent` and `sessions/` instead of your default `~/.omp` profile, and runs with that seat directory as `HOME`. OpenRig does not copy OMP credentials. The runner finds the real `omp` binary before switching `HOME`, so a version-manager shim such as mise on the daemon's `PATH` still works.
- **Credentials:** Provision each seat separately, or put the provider's key variable in `recovery.provider_auth_env_allowlist` (for example `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `MISTRAL_API_KEY`). The allowlist accepts the key variable of every provider in OpenRig's OMP provider map, from `anthropic` through `litellm`. A seat receives a key only when its `model` is written as `provider/id`, such as `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`. Short names such as `opus` pass no key. OMP also reads the launch directory's `.env`, so use a trusted working directory.
- **Approval posture:** The default floor is `--approval-mode always-ask`. Because the runner is headless, OMP approval requests are cancelled and the seat stays in needing-attention after the turn ends, until the next agent run starts. A `full_bypass` permission policy selects `--approval-mode yolo`.
- **Model errors:** A rejected prompt, a provider or authentication error during a turn, or exhausted automatic retries is printed in the pane and keeps the seat in needing-attention until the next agent run starts.
- **Restore:** OMP creates its session file after the first persisted turn. A new seat with no persisted turn has no resume token; restoring it requires `rig up --existing <rig> --fresh <seat>`. After that file exists, OpenRig restores that exact session file. If a full rig restore leaves an OMP seat in `attention_required` or `failed`, `rig seat clear-attention` cannot yet reconcile it to `operator_recovered`, even with `--reason`, because restore reconciliation only verifies Claude Code and Codex processes ([#41](https://github.com/mvschwarz/openrig/issues/41)). Relaunch that seat with `rig up --existing <rig> --fresh <seat>`, or restore it manually.

### Terminal Nodes

Terminal nodes are infrastructure processes (servers, log tails, build watchers) that are not agent runtimes. They require an exact triple:

```yaml
runtime: terminal
agent_ref: "builtin:terminal"
profile: none
```

All three must be present together. Any partial combination is a validation error.

### agent_ref Rules

- Must start with `local:` or `path:`
- `local:` paths are relative to the rig spec file's directory (the rig root)
- `path:` paths are absolute filesystem paths
- The referenced path must contain an `agent.yaml` file
- Exception: `builtin:terminal` for terminal nodes

### Session Naming

The canonical session name is derived from the pod ID, member ID, and rig name:

```
{podId}-{memberId}@{rigName}
```

Example: pod `dev`, member `impl`, rig `my-team` → session `dev-impl@my-team`

This is human-authored (you choose the pod/member IDs) and system-validated (the system enforces the format).

---

## Edges

### Edge Kinds

| Kind | Meaning | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| `delegates_to` | Source delegates work to target. Constrains launch order. | Orchestrator → implementer, lead → worker |
| `spawned_by` | Target was spawned by source. Constrains launch order. | Parent → child in hierarchical topologies |
| `can_observe` | Source can observe target's output. Does NOT constrain launch order. | Reviewer → implementer, monitor → worker |
| `collaborates_with` | Peer collaboration relationship. Does NOT constrain launch order. | Co-equal peers working together |
| `escalates_to` | Source escalates to target for decisions. Does NOT constrain launch order. | Worker → lead for escalation |

### Pod-Local Edges

Edges within a pod use **unqualified member IDs** (just the member `id`, not `pod.member`):

```yaml
pods:
  - id: dev
    members:
      - id: impl
        # ...
      - id: qa
        # ...
    edges:
      - kind: delegates_to
        from: impl      # NOT dev.impl
        to: qa          # NOT dev.qa
```

Both `from` and `to` must reference members that exist in the same pod.

### Cross-Pod Edges

Edges between pods use **fully-qualified `pod.member` IDs**:

```yaml
edges:
  - kind: delegates_to
    from: orch.lead     # pod.member format
    to: dev.impl        # pod.member format
```

Cross-pod edges must reference different pods. An edge where both `from` and `to` are in the same pod is a validation error — use pod-local edges instead.

---

## Startup Block

Startup blocks can appear at three levels: rig, pod, and member. They are merged additively via the startup layering model (see `docs/reference/startup-layering.md`).

### Files

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `path` | string | yes | — | Relative path to the file. Must be a safe relative path. |
| `delivery_hint` | string | no | `auto` | How the file is delivered. One of: `auto`, `guidance_merge`, `skill_install`, `send_text`. |
| `required` | boolean | no | `true` | Whether startup fails if this file cannot be delivered. |
| `applies_on` | string[] | no | `[fresh_start, restore]` | When this file is delivered. Subset of: `fresh_start`, `restore`. |

#### Delivery Hints

| Hint | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `auto` | System chooses based on file type and context. |
| `guidance_merge` | Merged into the runtime's guidance file (`CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`) as a managed block. Delivered before harness boot. |
| `skill_install` | Installed as a skill in the runtime's skill directory. Delivered before harness boot. |
| `send_text` | Sent as text to the agent's terminal after the harness is ready. Requires the agent TUI to be active. |

### Actions

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `type` | string | yes | — | Action type. One of: `slash_command`, `send_text`, `startup_proof`. Note: `shell` is explicitly NOT supported in v1. |
| `value` | string | yes | — | Command/text to send, or `authenticated` / `none` for `startup_proof`. |
| `phase` | string | no | `after_files` | When to execute text/commands. One of: `after_files` (after startup files are delivered), `after_ready` (after harness readiness check passes). Proof selection is resolved before projection regardless of phase. |
| `idempotent` | boolean | yes | — | Whether this action is safe to replay on restore. **Required field.** Non-idempotent actions must NOT include `restore` in `applies_on`. |
| `applies_on` | string[] | no | `[fresh_start, restore]` | When this action runs. Subset of: `fresh_start`, `restore`. |

### Startup proof selection

Startup adds no orientation exercise by default. To select the authenticated
startup challenge, declare an action in an agent, profile, rig, pod, member, or
operator startup block:

```yaml
startup:
  actions:
    - type: startup_proof
      value: authenticated
      idempotent: true
```

Use `value: none` in a later layer to select lean startup explicitly. The last
applicable declaration wins in agent → profile → rig → pod → member → operator
order. Culture contributes files, not a proof selection. With no applicable
declaration, the result is `none`; the number of startup files never selects
proof. Invalid values and non-idempotent proof declarations fail validation,
including declarations overridden later. These actions declare policy and are
never typed into a terminal.

An authenticated selection challenges only a fresh or fresh-fallback managed
agent launch. Resumed, forked, rebuilt, and adopted sessions receive no new
challenge; terminal nodes never receive one. `applies_on` follows the requested
startup context, so a fresh fallback during restore uses `restore` selections.
Keep the default `[fresh_start, restore]` to cover both fresh launch paths.

Identity delivery, projection, readiness, and ordinary startup actions still
run. `startup_status: ready` means startup completed, while `oriented: missing`
means a selected proof awaits authenticated submission. Omission/`none` yields
`oriented: n-a` on a new fresh launch and retires an older challenge without
deleting its audit history. Retirement follows successful harness launch,
before readiness checks, so attention, timeout, or a readiness exception cannot
retain the preceding proof. A replacement that fails to launch does not retire
the current proof; resume/adoption also preserves existing proof history.
The effective selection is recorded on `node.startup_pending`; actions are
persisted in startup context for restore and fresh relaunch.

---

## Services Block

The services block is optional. When present, services boot before any agent node launches. If service health checks fail, agent launch is blocked.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `kind` | string | yes | — | Service backend. Only `compose` is supported in v1. |
| `compose_file` | string | yes | — | Relative path to the Docker Compose file. Must be a safe relative path. Resolved relative to rig root. |
| `project_name` | string | no | derived from rig name | Docker Compose project name. Must match `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*`. If omitted, derived by sanitizing the rig name. |
| `profiles` | string[] | no | — | Compose profiles to activate. |
| `down_policy` | string | no | `down` | What happens on `rig down`. One of: `leave_running`, `down`, `down_and_volumes`. |
| `wait_for` | WaitTarget[] | no | — | Health targets that must pass before agent launch. |
| `surfaces` | Surfaces | no | — | Metadata about accessible URLs and commands. Not executed — informational only. |
| `checkpoints` | CheckpointHook[] | no | — | Shell commands for checkpoint export/import during snapshot/restore. |

### Wait Targets

Each target must define exactly one of `service`, `url`, or `tcp`:

```yaml
wait_for:
  # HTTP probe — any 2xx or 3xx response passes the HTTP wait target; redirects are not followed.
  # This proves the server answered, not application readiness.
  - url: http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/health

  # TCP probe — connects to host:port
  - tcp: "127.0.0.1:5432"

  # Compose health check — requires Docker health to report "healthy"
  - service: postgres
    condition: healthy
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `url` | string | one of three | HTTP URL to probe. |
| `tcp` | string | one of three | `host:port` for TCP probe. |
| `service` | string | one of three | Compose service name. Requires `condition: healthy`. |
| `condition` | string | only with `service` | Must be `healthy`. Only valid with `service` targets. |

### Surfaces

```yaml
surfaces:
  urls:
    - name: Vault UI
      url: http://127.0.0.1:8200/ui
  commands:
    - name: Vault status
      command: "vault status -address=http://127.0.0.1:8200"
```

Surfaces are metadata only. They are displayed in the UI and in `rig env status` output but are NOT executed by OpenRig.

### Checkpoint Hooks

```yaml
checkpoints:
  - id: postgres
    export: "docker compose exec -T postgres pg_dump -U app > {{artifacts_dir}}/postgres.sql"
    import: "cat {{artifacts_dir}}/postgres.sql | docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U app"
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique identifier for this checkpoint. |
| `export` | string | yes | Shell command to export state. `{{artifacts_dir}}` is replaced with a daemon-managed path. |
| `import` | string | no | Shell command to import state on restore. |

Checkpoint hooks are shell commands run by the daemon. They are best-effort — a failed export does not block snapshot, but continuity is classified as `receipt_only` instead of `checkpointed`.

---

## Continuity Policy

Optional pod-level configuration for compaction recovery behavior.

```yaml
continuity_policy:
  enabled: true
  sync_triggers: [pre_compaction, pre_shutdown, manual, milestone]
  artifacts:
    session_log: true
    restore_brief: true
    quiz: false
  restore_protocol:
    peer_driven: true
    verify_via_quiz: false
```

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | yes | — | Whether continuity is active for this pod. |
| `sync_triggers` | string[] | no | — | When to sync. Values: `pre_compaction`, `pre_shutdown`, `manual`, `milestone`. |
| `artifacts.session_log` | boolean | no | — | Whether to maintain a session log. |
| `artifacts.restore_brief` | boolean | no | — | Whether to maintain a restore brief. |
| `artifacts.quiz` | boolean | no | — | Whether to use quiz-based verification. |
| `restore_protocol.peer_driven` | boolean | no | — | Whether peers drive the restore process. |
| `restore_protocol.verify_via_quiz` | boolean | no | — | Whether to verify restoration via quiz. |

---
