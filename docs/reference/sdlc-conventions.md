# SDLC conventions — the markdown control plane

OpenRig is a software factory the human steers from a high altitude. The human
records intent; agents turn intent into a plan, the plan into a build, the
build into proof. The TUI projects authored work on disk and, where an owning
proof policy is selected, derives readiness from recorded judgments. These
authoring conventions are **advisory / fail-open for agents**: the audit
records and advises; the selected proof policy separately governs who may judge.


## HOW TO READ THIS DOCUMENT — two parts, and only one of them is the default

| | applies | contents |
|---|---|---|
| **PART A — THE SIMPLE SDLC** | **ALWAYS. This is the default.** | artifact conventions, proportionality, the advisory audit, the honesty rails |
| **PART B — THE RIGOROUS OVERLAY** | **ONLY when the human operator, or an orchestrator relaying that decision, ASSIGNS the heavy path to a NAMED piece of work** | the proof-contract format, the two locks, C1 proof drops, the locked role contracts |

**You may not select Part B for yourself.** If you believe something earns it, say so in ONE
sentence and continue on Part A until told otherwise. Part A corresponds to the `mission-slice-sop`
skill; Part B is defined below and applies only when assigned.


## THE COMPONENT MENU — this document is a menu, not a pipeline

The SDLC is assembled from **components chosen per mission**, not a single mandated flow.
This document describes the components and carries recommendations; a mission (or the team
running it) picks per phase. Multiple valid options can exist for the same phase — choosing
one does not deprecate the others. Nothing below deletes or overrides an existing component.

| phase | components available today |
|---|---|
| **PRODUCT / MISSION PREPARATION** | **The product-management pass** — the layer above planning, run by the advisor/PM seat before planners touch a mission. The build is a lossy compression pipeline (PM intent → planner spec → builder code); nothing leaks downward by proximity, so this pass grounds in the raw sources, synthesizes ONE scope of record, presents owner decisions decision-ready, mints slices at plan time, deposits the full design contract INLINE in each design-bearing spec (owner words verbatim, settled decisions, evidence, shape of done, anti-goals), routes the complete reading list and internet-research assignments from the spec itself, frames each slice's planning-dial rung with its reason, and rereads every spec as the narrow downstream reader. The measuring stick: SPEC.md alone, plus what it explicitly routes to, reproduces the intent in a reader with none of the author's context. Full reference: `product-management-pass.md`. |
| **PLAN** | **The planning dial** — planning rigor is a spectrum chosen per piece: P0 mini-requirements and pointers (simple, reversible work) · P1 an authored spec with a proof contract (the default) · P2 plus a research round before the spec freezes, run BEFORE build dispatch · P3 plus an adversarial pass by a non-author, judged against product goals, landing amendments with proof-contract teeth · P4 plus a blind from-scratch design diffed against priors before proceeding. Dial up by what the piece is, exactly as build care is priced below. Full reference: `planning-dial.md`. |
| **BUILD** | **Part A, the simple flow** (below — the default) · **product-journey components** — a mission-selectable menu for greenfield work, drift recovery, public journey probes, one evidence-gated look at the layer below, minimal repair, independent QA/review, integration, and installed smoke; compose only what the work needs in mission/slice YAML, never as a new mode or mandatory pipeline. Full reference: `product-journey-sdlc.md` · **the wave model** — slices build in parallel in disjoint file territories, an integrator merges serially, and independent review fires once per wave (two reviewers with different vantages, never the writers; fix rounds re-earn verdicts at one final revision; per-slice discipline stays failing-test-first and verify-by-effect). The wave IS the care dial: what shares a wave decides how much review each piece gets · **Part B, the rigorous overlay** (below — only when assigned). These combine: a wave can carry one Part-B piece. Full wave reference: `wave-sdlc.md`. |
| **DISPATCH DATA** | **The execution-data conventions (S27)** — three tiny data disciplines that make execution state derivable instead of hand-tabulated, consumed by `rig view show execution`. **EC-1, edges in frontmatter:** every open slice carries its hard edges in `depends_on:` (an inline JSON array; an explicit `[]` is a statement, absence is INDETERMINATE); soft/serialization edges are one machine-readable Territory line, exactly `SOFT-AFTER: [ids] — reason`. **EC-2, wave-as-data:** wave composition + review model live on a durable queue row tagged `wave-map` + `format:wave-map-v1` whose body carries one fenced ```json block (`{format:"wave-map-v1", mission, waves:[{id, slices, serialized_order?, review_model?}]}`) — composition only, never status labels (status derives at read time); the planning dial recorded at lock surfaces as the frontmatter field `approved-spec-dial:` beside the approve stamp. **EC-3, dispatch names the worktree:** build batons carry the exact body line `worktree_path=<path>` from dispatch onward — it is Q1's join key; batons without it join by naming only and the view marks them `fragile_join`. Existing batons are never rewritten. |
| **RELEASE** | The release ceremony conventions (publication identity, honest release notes) and the CAPABILITY-DELTA LIFECYCLE LAW: each release's delta is authored at the fence and bound to the exact candidate, then reconciled to the published cut. Expiry requires both the canon header naming the absorbed delta and a distinct successor delta existing; a draft header alone is insufficient. Verify the actual boundary event and stop citing an expired delta. Full statement: `release-boundary.md` §6. |
| **BOUNDARY** | **The release boundary** — housekeeping run once per fence so the next release starts clean: seats reset or re-primed per their continuity needs, memory distilled (keep what changed a decision recently), every queue swept by destination and dispositioned, substrate torn down, boards frozen as records, a clean-box baseline captured. A checklist of judgment guides, not gates. Full reference: `release-boundary.md`. |

Mission and slice YAML may select component IDs from
`product-journey-sdlc.md` and record explicit edges between them. That YAML is
an address map and execution dashboard prototype, not an enforcement engine.
If it is absent, Part A remains the complete default; agents do not invent a
composition merely to make one exist.

# PART A — THE SIMPLE SDLC (applies always)

## A1. The flow in one pass

```
intent (what is this for, what does done look like)
      → build it
      → test it with your own eyes
      → record honestly what you verified, and what you did NOT
      → hand off (rig queue handoff) or stop
```

Verify the whole outcome at completion, not through a review chain per increment.
For a tiny change the builder may hold this check. Independent QA/review runs only
when selected by the project/mission/slice composition or an explicit owner
assignment; for a wave, at its authored boundary. Available roles never add gates.
The authority lookup is `product-journey-sdlc.md#resolve-the-selected-path`.
Bring work with evidence that its promised user outcome actually works.

For a release mission, `mission.yaml` also names the Git strategy before build
work starts: the branch/ref that is cumulative integration truth, its base, and
when that truth is reconciled to main. Continuous integration to main and a
release-line fold followed by one explicit merge are both valid; leaving the
choice implicit is not.

**The heavier flow — proof contracts, plan-lock, C1 drops, proof-lock — is PART B and is not in
force unless assigned.**

## A2. Slice artifact conventions (what the UI projects)

Each slice directory carries:

- **`SPEC.md`** — the one authored node file. Its frontmatter carries
  `intent:` and may carry `depends_on:` as a list of sibling work-node IDs;
  `depends_on` orders siblings and is never followed by the path-only context
  trace. The body opens with the three convention sections, in this order and
  with these exact headings:
  - **`## Intent`** — the recorded intent, verbatim. The UI projects this
    text as the INTENT section.
  - **`## Mini-requirements`** — the concise, one-glance requirement tier
    (numbered list). This is the human operator's first structured catchpoint;
    approval starts here.
  - **`## Proof contract`** — a checkbox list of promised deliverables (see
    §3). The UI's DELIVERED section pairs each item with its proof.
- **`PROGRESS.md`** — the slice's current delivery state and retained outcome
  log. Record material changes with links to proof; historical checkboxes are
  testimony, not current acceptance authority. For a selected proof policy,
  `rig proof show <slice>` derives current readiness from the proof contract
  and attributed judgments. In-process steps stay in the working agent's
  own todo tool.
- **`PROOF.md`** — the retained proof summary, explicitly paired to the
  `SPEC.md` proof contract.
- **`proof/`** — the proof-artifact directory. Curated canonical evidence
  lands here via `rig proof` with valid C1 headers (§5).

Legacy `README.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION-PRD.md`, and pre-convention trees remain
readable indefinitely. New scaffolds do not create or mirror them, and repair
is additive: it never deletes, renames, or rewrites legacy bytes.

When the owning scope selects `proofPolicy.judges`, use `rig proof judge` to
record an attributed accept, reject or withdraw decision on a contract item,
and `rig proof show` to read derived readiness up through slice, mission and
project. The nearest slice, mission or project policy selects authorized judges;
`rig proof --help` describes setup, selectors and evidence requirements. A
correction preserves history and unrelated judgments without editing ancestor
status checklists. An artifact can identify non-code work without a fabricated
commit. Evidence capture (`proof add`), policy acceptance, higher outcome
judgment and publication are distinct. This optional component does not select
Part B or add a mandatory review gate.

The three sections project into the UI's one review structure: a vertical
stack of **INTENT → PLAN → DELIVERED**. A slice missing a section still
renders (the projection degrades to a muted "—", never invents content) —
but it does not carry its weight in review.

## A3. Honesty rails (public surfaces + cited hashes)

### Public-repo surfaces read as product engineering

Commit messages, code comments, and markdown/docs are **public-repo surfaces**: they
ship to readers who have no access to — and no interest in — how the work was
governed internally. Two rules, **forward-only** (existing history is not rewritten
for these):

- **No verbatim internal quotes**, and especially not emotional or frustrated ones.
  Quote the *technical content* of a decision, never the person or the mood in which
  it was made.
- **No governance framing.** Write what the change does and why it is correct on its
  own terms — not who ruled it, who approved it, or which internal gate it passed.
  "The guard fires at lock because a placeholder would otherwise satisfy the join"
  is product engineering. "X ruled this at the Y gate" is internal governance leaking
  into a public artifact.

The test: a reader outside the project should be able to act on the text without
knowing any internal role, seat, or process name. This is the same principle applied
to attribution and tone rather than to vocabulary.
### A cited hash STATES WHAT IT COVERS

A hash offered as evidence is only checkable if the reader knows what bytes it
was taken over. **State the coverage with the hash**, in one of two forms:

- **whole-file** — and say so, including whether a **trailing newline** is
  inside the hashed bytes; or
- **file + an exact span definition** — the span is *part of the definition*,
  not a hint about where to look.

Two honest people can hash the same artifact and get different digests without
either being wrong (for example, one over the frontmatter block and one over
the whole file). Coverage is what makes a cited hash verifiable rather than
merely impressive.

**Use path + anchor as the authority and a whole-file hash only to date the
citation.** The address survives legitimate content changes; the digest does not.

## A4. When implementation finds the intent rested on something that does not exist

A slice's intent can only be honoured to the extent its assumptions hold. Sometimes implementation
discovers that a LOCKED intent depends on functionality that **is not there** — not a missing
detail, a missing capability.

**The honest response is to revise the ambition DOWN to what reality supports, and name the missing
functionality as its own work.** Mark the slice **PARTIAL**, and write one document that tells a
downstream reader the accurate story:

1. what the intent asked for (quote the locked text)
2. what actually shipped, and how it was verified BY EFFECT
3. **what did not ship and precisely why** — name each missing capability, at source, with the file
   and line that proves it is absent
4. what the delivery does NOT cover, stated plainly — a scenario or feature that overstates its
   coverage is worse than one that does not exist
5. **follow-on slices scoped from what you know NOW**, including which release you think they belong
   in — the agents holding the context at discovery time are the most knowledgeable readers that
   problem will ever have, and a downstream planner should not have to rediscover any of it

**What is NOT acceptable:** silently narrowing the claim; quietly expanding the slice to build the
missing capability; or declaring victory on a reduced surface while still using the original slice's
name. **Building the missing pieces inside the slice IS the scope creep.** Discovering them and
routing them is the slice working correctly — and a slice that reveals a real product gap has
produced something more valuable than the feature it set out to deliver.

Do not over-engineer this. The entire goal is an accurate story for whoever reads it next.

## A5. The elastic middle (proportionality — no minted ceremony)

The SDLC has exactly three fixed capture points: **intent** → a
**proportional structured requirement** → **proof**. Everything between is
elastic. For a small slice (a bug fix, a research note), the
mini-requirements may BE the whole specification — the convention sections must be
present so the slice projects, but their contents scale to the work. Gates
are losslessness checks on the decompression from intent to delivery, not
paperwork. Scaffolding emits the sections; it must never mint ceremony.
## A6. The audit (advisory, fail-open — always)

`rig scope audit` (and the advisory rows in `rig workspace validate` /
`doctor`) checks these conventions: the section headings present, the proof
contract well-formed, `proof/` artifacts carrying valid C1 headers, UI slices
referencing a mockup. Every finding **records and advises — it never blocks a
write path and never changes exit semantics into a gate**. Unknown is
reported as unknown, not failure.
## A7. Where the knowledge lives (the four pointers)

- **This document** — the SSOT.
- **Scaffold**: `rig scope slice create` emits `SPEC.md` + `PROGRESS.md` +
  `PROOF.md` + `proof/` for every template kind; `rig scope mission create`
  emits an intent-bearing `SPEC.md` + `NOTES.md`. Core emits only this
  mode-neutral shape; mode plugins add richer material through the extension
  seam rather than teaching core a mode.
- **Skill**: `mission-slice-sop` teaches **Part A**, the light default. **Part B**
  is defined below and applies only when assigned — never self-selected.
- **Bootstrap**: the shipped agent overlay points fresh seats at the skill
  and this document at boot.

# PART B — THE RIGOROUS OVERLAY (assigned only)

> **ENTRY CONDITION:** everything below applies **only** when the human operator — or an orchestrator
> explicitly relaying that decision — has assigned the heavy path to a **named** piece of work.
> If you arrived here without an assignment, stop and use Part A.
>
> **Rails:** the locks are **two, and only two**. Nothing here authorizes a second gate round on
> the same work, a gate on documentation / comments / tests / fixtures, or asking a peer to gate
> what you can verify with your own eyes. **Cut rounds, never checks.** The tier is **re-chosen**
> when the surface changes.

## B0. The assigned flow in one pass

```
intent → mini-requirements + proof contract → (UI slices: mockups)
      → plan-lock (rig scope slice approve --scope spec)
      → build the LOCKED set
      → QA: mockup ↔ delivered VISUAL compare
      → proof drops (rig proof add <slice> …)
      → proof-lock (rig scope slice approve --scope delivery)
```

## B1. The proof contract format

`## Proof contract` is a markdown checkbox list; each item is one promised
deliverable, written as an observable outcome:

```markdown
## Proof contract

- [ ] The consolidated `rig ps` default renders all rigs with a rollup footer — captured.
- [ ] UI: the slice review tab renders the three-section stack — screenshot vs the locked mockup.
```

- Each item is joined (by item text or 1-based index) to the proof artifacts
  that evidence it — that pairing is what the DELIVERED section renders, so
  the human never hunts through dozens of artifacts to find which one proves
  what.
- **UI deliverables carry a planned mockup** (`plannedRef`): the planning
  agent produces the mockup and attaches it to the locked set. A UI slice
  with no mockup in its locked set is an incomplete plan. Non-UI slices
  (backend, skills, markdown) have no mockup and no `plannedRef` — that is
  not a gap and not a gate.
- A deliverable QA did not actually verify shows as `unverified`/`missing`
  in the UI — visible, never hard-blocking.

## B2. The two locks (shipped verb — not new machinery)

Two deliberate stamps, both written by the SAME shipped verb
(`rig scope slice approve`, one daemon-side write path: frontmatter stamp +
append-only audit row land together):

- **Plan-lock:** `rig scope slice approve <slice> --scope spec` — "the spec
  matches my intent; THIS artifact set is what gets built." Pins `SPEC.md`
  (and planned mockups, when present) out of everything else in the folder.
- **Proof-lock:** `rig scope slice approve <slice> --scope delivery`
  (the default scope) — the terminal "this is done" sign-off; fires the
  freeze.

Approval is freeze/sign-off — **never** proven-green. Proven-green requires a
recorded verdict (a C1 proof artifact, §5); presence of an approval stamp does
not assert the work was proven. `--on-behalf-of` records delegation honestly
(the actor stays the real invoking session).

## B3. Proof drops and the C1 header (closed sets)

Proof artifacts land in `proof/` via the shipped verb:

```bash
rig proof add <slice> \
  --artifact-type qa \
  --verdict PASS \
  --candidate-sha <the-proven-tip> \
  --money-evidence "one line of money evidence" \
  --file <artifact.md> \
  --evidences "1,3" \
  --media "walk.webm,panel.png" \
  --self-check "I looked at the captures; they show the claim"
```

The C1 header's five required fields: `slice`, `candidate_sha`,
`artifact_type`, `verdict`, `money_evidence`. Two **ratified closed sets**
(extending either is a convention change, not a local edit):

- `artifact_type`: `guard | qa | rev1-r1 | rev1-r2 | adjudication`
- `verdict`: `CLEAR | BLOCKING | CONCERNING | PASS | NOT-CLEAR`

`candidate_sha` is the join key: the proven candidate tip this artifact
judges. `--evidences` names which proof-contract deliverable(s) the drop
covers (item text or 1-based index) — that reference populates the
planned↔delivered pairing. `--self-check` is the agent's recorded assertion
that it LOOKED at the evidence. `--media` names the curated media files
(relative to the slice's `proof/` dir — co-located, never absolute) this
drop stands behind; the composer projects them into the DELIVERED items'
proof set. Validation happens at drop time; the audit
(§6) backstops artifacts that arrived by other paths. **Hand-placing files
in `proof/` without a drop is the anti-pattern**: the deliverable stays
unpaired and `unverified` in the DELIVERED view — always attach media via
`--media` on a drop.

## B4. Role contracts (what makes the structure self-enforcing)

- **Planning agent:** authors intent verbatim, the mini-requirements, and the
  `## Proof contract` (each UI deliverable with its mockup `plannedRef`);
  produces the mockups; locks the plan (`--scope spec`).
- **Build agent:** builds against the LOCKED set only; looks at the mockups,
  not just the spec text.
- **QA agent (owns the compare):** for each deliverable — load the locked
  `plannedRef`, produce the real artifact in a test/demo environment,
  **visually compare**, record the verdict + note via a proof drop, and
  **curate** the canonical proof set. On mismatch beyond minutiae: fix and
  have another agent review, or kick back with the reason — never escalate a
  raw mismatch to the human. A proof drop with no recorded comparison leaves
  the deliverable `unverified` — visibly.

**Curation rule:** the primary proof set is the curated canonical "this is
what it looks like now" evidence the agent stands behind — bounded, mapped
1:1 (or few:1) to deliverables. The fix-loop's full artifact history stays in
`proof/`, one drill-in down, NEVER in the primary view. The anti-pattern:
an append-only pile where the human can't tell final from superseded.

## Scratch-daemon hermeticity: the DB a scratch daemon opens is the one you named

A scratch daemon launch **strips the inherited environment's `OPENRIG_DB` and names an explicit
scratch DB path under the scratch `OPENRIG_HOME`** — both halves, every launch:

```bash
env -u OPENRIG_DB \
  OPENRIG_HOME="$SCRATCH_HOME" \
  OPENRIG_DB="$SCRATCH_HOME/openrig.sqlite" \
  node <daemon entry> …
```

An inherited fleet DB reaching a scratch daemon is a **harness defect regardless of outcome** —
the scratch context read or wrote state it never owned, and whether anything visibly broke is
luck, not hermeticity.

**The discriminator that keeps this rule honest:** an explicit `OPENRIG_DB` still WINS by design
(`daemon-db-path.ts`) — deliberate split-path configuration remains legitimate and
untouched. This rule governs **inheritance into scratch contexts**, where nobody
decided anything: strip what you did not choose, then choose.
