# OpenRig CLI Reference

Verified against the shipped CLI on 2026-06-15 (v0.3.4) using:
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/*.ts`
- `packages/cli/src/mcp-server.ts`
- live help from `node packages/cli/dist/index.js ... --help`

This document reflects the current `rig` surface as shipped. Where live help text is narrower than the implementation, notes call that out explicitly.

## Terminal dashboard entry

The TUI's **Connections** section (`connections` or `:connections`) shows
running daemon and launching CLI identity, selected instance settings with
source, observed rigs and authored Specs, Slack configuration and running wire
state, and registered humans with primary/secondary bindings. `back` restores
the work view that opened Connections. The view supplies supported CLI guidance;
it does not enable a connector, change settings, or send a test message.

Connections reads the passive `GET /api/gateway/connections` projection. It
selects safe fields from settings, config, the human registry and gateway status;
secret values/references and raw errors are omitted. Current config is compared
with the wire's activation digest when available. Last Slack verification comes
from at most 64 KiB of the existing channel-operation audit tail, matched to the
current configuration and labeled with its time/actor. It is historical scope
and channel-membership evidence, not current reachability, credential identity,
delivery or readership. Missing, failed, incomplete and changed observations
remain distinct; an older daemon without the projection reads as unavailable.
Use the displayed guidance on that instance; `rig slack verify --json` explicitly
contacts Slack. Ordinary navigation/refresh does not.

`rig tui` opens an independent TUI through the same front door as bare `rig`.
`rig tui --shared` requires interactive input/output and a loopback daemon
connection. It resolves the kernel's bound `operator.human` terminal and
attaches a local tmux client without starting a seat or another TUI. Ctrl-b,
then d detaches; reattaching preserves navigation. A missing or ambiguous
binding fails with inspection guidance instead of creating another kernel.

Fresh kernel terminals start `rig tui` automatically. Older terminals, or a
terminal where the TUI was quit, retain their shell: run `rig tui` there once.
The kernel view uses TUI instance `kernel`; standalone uses its ordinary
instance. `rig tui commands --json` exposes the command registry for agent
control. In the ordinary shell, Tab completes command names/aliases, section
jumps and arguments from the current snapshot. Ambiguous prefixes show candidates;
keep typing and press Tab again. No match preserves the text. Enter executes;
Escape clears. Free-text filters are not completed. Bracketed paste is text, never
an implicit command submission.

Recent shows ordered, wrapped queue changes. Enter on an event opens the original
record (including its raw timestamp); Escape returns to the previous view/scroll.
Recorded changes remain attributed claims, including attempts and failures.

Absolute TUI times use `ui.timezone`, default `America/Los_Angeles`, with native
daylight-saving rules. Run `timezone` in the TUI for the current value and settings
guidance. `rig config set ui.timezone Europe/London` persists an alternative;
`rig config reset ui.timezone` restores the default. Reopen the TUI after changing
it. `OPENRIG_UI_TIMEZONE` overrides the file setting. Invalid settings produce a
visible fallback notice. Relative ages and stored source timestamps are unchanged.

See [the first-use journey](../reference/getting-started.md).

## Daemon shutdown

`rig daemon stop` sends at most one SIGTERM to a live daemon identified by its
local state.
An explicit `OPENRIG_URL` that disagrees with that target refuses before signaling.
The daemon has one referenced **10-second** budget covering asynchronous service
shutdown, connections and recorder drain; repeated SIGINT/SIGTERM joins that stop.
The CLI allows **12 seconds** for process exit, then verifies the original PID and
listener even if `daemon.json` was removed. A refused listener, a responding
listener and an unavailable probe are different outcomes.

`$OPENRIG_HOME/daemon-shutdown.json` records the PID, shutdown start/completion,
phase, failures and `clean|failed|timed-out` outcome. Only successful drains mark
the lifecycle record clean. A failed/timed-out drain returns nonzero, including
after the process exits. For a recorded target, missing or stale receipt evidence
is unverified and also returns nonzero. Failed/unverified stops retain target
state for retries; status reads only clean it after a matching clean receipt.
An already-exited target uses the same receipt judgment without another signal.
With no recorded target and a refused listener, the CLI reports a distinct
no-target no-op, not a clean-drain verdict. Unbound incomplete or unreadable
local shutdown evidence remains nonzero/unverified rather than being attributed
to an unrelated listener.

Older daemons without the receipt can therefore be proven stopped without their
graceful drain being certified. Inspect the receipt and `daemon.log`;
do not infer that pending external work completed or was rolled back, or retry it
blindly. The bound covers asynchronous waits, not a synchronous event-loop wedge.

## Human delivery

`rig gateway human list --json` discovers registered `<entityId>@external`
addresses. `rig gateway human show <entityId> --json` includes primary-connector
readiness, reason and next inspection. Project policy decides when to contact a
human; `messaging-the-human` supplies the transport mechanics.

Create a human request with `rig queue create --destination <address> --summary
"<decision>" --body-file <file> --evidence-ref <ref> --verify --json`. It persists
one row before checking the delivery receipt. `posted` proves connector
acceptance, never readership; `transport-failed`, `never-posted`, `still-pending`
and `indeterminate` preserve the request and name the next inspection. Do not
blindly repeat the create. `rig send` is for agent seats.

`rig slack manifest [--url|--json]` (experimental in 0.6.0) prints the Slack app manifest a user creates
their own private Socket Mode app from, offline (no daemon, tokens or network).
`--url` is Slack's create-app link with the manifest prefilled; `--json` adds the
scope and event lists and why each scope is requested. The same object is served
read-only at `GET /api/gateway/slack/manifest` for the TUI Connections page. Setup
steps: `docs/reference/slack-app-setup.md`.

`rig slack enable [--reason <reason>]` seeds existing backlog only on a disabled
to enabled transition. Repeating enable does not reseed or restart. `rig slack
disable --reason <reason>` requires a shutdown reason. Both return attributed
lifecycle receipts; direct requests can name `actor` when no managed-session
header exists. Header-derived and claimed identities remain distinct.
Configuration, verification and human-binding edits also record actor, reason,
prior/result state and effect in
`$OPENRIG_HOME/state/human-channel-operations.jsonl`. Each operation has a start
and a completion receipt with one ID; a missing completion is indeterminate.
Snapshots retain state/digests rather than credentials or message bodies. Local
CLI configuration/verification/binding receipts are explicitly `claimed:v1`.

`rig host pair <url> [--human <address>]` selects the sole registered target
human, or requires an explicit selection when several exist. A missing registry
or ambiguous recipient refuses before creating an approval. An unset
`workspace.operator_seat_name` no longer invents a username-derived kernel
seat: Mission Control discovers a single registered human or shows identity
uncertainty. Explicit existing seat selections remain supported. Legacy aliases
resolve only when their entity is registered; old failed rows are preserved,
not implicitly delivered or replayed by registration.

## Overview

System Health diagnosis, policy, checkpoints, and dispositions are documented in
[Agent-operated System Health diagnosis](../reference/health-diagnosis.md).
Diagnosis `show`/`list --json` are summaries; use `--full --json` for the previous
complete evidence payload. Their defaults identify omitted fields and the exact
expansion command. Workflow human views remain summaries; workflow `--json`
continues to return the complete API payload.

For raw JSON evidence files, CLI read defaults cannot intercept `cat` or a Node
print. Inspect size and keys before selecting needed fields; retain full evidence
on disk. For example:

```sh
wc -c < receipt.json
jq 'keys' receipt.json
jq '{gate, judge, cutSha, surfaceCount, overallPackageVerdict}' receipt.json
```

Select the actual fields present in that file. Redirect intentional full CLI
output to a file before inspecting selected fields; use `set -o pipefail` when
piping a command so a formatter cannot hide its failing exit.


- Binary: `rig`
- Top-level command groups: `64`
- Output mode: human-readable by default; many commands also support `--json`
- Daemon-backed commands fail when the daemon is stopped or unhealthy; `daemon`, `config`, `preflight`, and `doctor` also have local responsibilities
- Managed apps are launched through the normal spec/library surfaces; the canonical shipped example is `rig up secrets-manager`
- Legacy surface still shipped: `package`

## Core Daemon and System Commands

### `rig daemon`

Usage: `rig daemon <subcommand>`

Subcommands:
- `start [--port <port>] [--host <host>] [--db <path>]`
- `stop`
- `status`
- `logs [--follow]`

Notes:
- `start` additively reconciles the canonical instance layout before launching
  the daemon process, then accepts runtime overrides for port, host, and DB
  path. Direct daemon first start uses the same initializer. Existing files are
  preserved and wrong-type managed paths are refused before any write. See
  `docs/reference/instance-layout.md`.
- Startup uses a local `daemon-start.lock` reservation before instance initialization,
  shared by `daemon start`, `start`, and `up`. A concurrent supported launch fails
  without spawning another daemon or running its pre-bind database initialization.
  Success requires the spawned child's numeric PID from `/healthz` at every required
  listener and a live child through atomic `daemon.json` publication. Missing or
  mismatched process identity, an invalid listener plan, child exit, and unresolved
  probes cannot publish success. Use a matching CLI/daemon pair; a legacy endpoint
  without PID evidence is insufficient. This local reservation does not serialize
  old binaries or direct execution of the daemon entrypoint.
- Startup checks physical liveness after the synchronous state writer as well as
  before it; queued child events alone cannot prove that boundary. If publication
  fails verification, startup rejects and withdraws only state matching this
  launch's PID, start time, listener and DB. It never removes a replacement owner.
- Failed process inspection is uncertainty, not proof that a child exited. Cleanup
  waits for the owned child's exit evidence; an error event is insufficient.
- Failed startup signals only its own child and waits boundedly for its exit. If
  cleanup cannot be confirmed, the reservation remains and the error names the PID.
  An interrupted launcher can also leave `daemon-start.lock`. Inspect its recorded
  launcher/child PIDs, `daemon.json`, and `daemon.log`; only after proving both
  processes absent, archive that reservation before retrying. There is no timed
  takeover: a dead launcher may have left a live, unbound child.
- `logs` reads daemon log output and can follow it.
- **Deploy identity (v0.4.4, OPR.0.4.4.11 FR-6/7)**: a PACKAGED build (built via `scripts/build-package.sh`) is stamped with `{semver, commit, dirty, builtAt}`; the daemon's `/healthz` payload carries the four stamp fields additively and `rig --version` renders `<semver> (<commit8>[, dirty])`. A source/dev run has no build stamp (never an invented SHA); `/healthz` still reports its runtime PID and `--version` prints the plain semver. This is the 30-second stale-deploy diagnostic: an unstamped or old-commit `/healthz` on a long-running host means you are looking at an older deployed build, not the source tree. Source: `packages/{daemon,cli}/src/build-info.ts` (`stampFields`), `packages/daemon/src/server.ts` (`/healthz`), `packages/cli/src/version.ts`.

### `rig status`

Usage: `rig status`

Notes:
- Human-oriented summary command.
- Prints daemon state, rig summary, and cmux availability.
- Does not support `--json`.

### `rig ui`

Usage: `rig ui open`

The OpenRig UI is experimental and in maintenance mode. It is not under active development; support is best-effort. The CLI is the primary supported interface. Contributions welcome.

The web UI and its terminal WebSocket are off by default. To enable them:

```bash
rig config set ui.enabled true
rig daemon stop
rig daemon start
rig ui open
```

The daemon reads `ui.enabled` at startup. Changing the setting does not change a running daemon; stop and start it to apply the change. The CLI, TUI, and API remain available when the web UI is disabled.

Subcommands:
- `open`

### `rig config`

Usage:
- `rig config [--json] [--with-source]`
- `rig config get <key> [--show-source]`
- `rig config set <key> <value>`
- `rig config reset [<key>]`
- `rig config init-workspace [--root <path>] [--force] [--dry-run] [--json]`

Supported keys:
- `daemon.port`
- `daemon.host`
- `db.path`
- `transcripts.enabled`
- `transcripts.path`
- `workspace.root` (and other workspace-rooted paths used by `init-workspace`)
- `context.root` (default `$OPENRIG_HOME/context`; env
  `OPENRIG_CONTEXT_ROOT`) — the single writable addressable context library.
  The removed `context.packs_root`, config field `context.packsRoot`, and env
  `OPENRIG_CONTEXT_PACKS_ROOT` are refused with replacement guidance.
- `context.system_world` (default `default`; env
  `OPENRIG_CONTEXT_SYSTEM_WORLD`) — selects
  `$OPENRIG_HOME/context/system/system-world.yaml`, an explicit replacement
  manifest path, or the explicit `disabled` state. `rig context work-install`
  reports the resolved state and provenance.
- `skills.root` (default `$OPENRIG_HOME/skills`; env `OPENRIG_SKILLS_ROOT`) — the
  one authoritative Git-versioned managed skill catalog. An override replaces
  the default; it does not add an overlay root.
- `snapshots.periodic.enabled` (default `true`) — daemon-side periodic snapshot scheduler on/off (v0.3.4)
- `snapshots.periodic.interval_seconds` (default `300`) — interval between periodic snapshots
- `snapshots.periodic.retention_keep` (default `10`) — number of periodic snapshots to retain per rig
- `feed.subscriptions.{action_required|approvals|shipped|progress|audit_log}` (booleans) — the For-You feed's five flat lens toggles (`OPENRIG_FEED_SUBSCRIPTIONS_*` env mapping)
- `feed.subscriptions.<hostId>.enabled` (boolean; **v0.4.4, OPR.0.4.4.15**) — ONE registered dynamic key CLASS (not a general dynamic-key mechanism): per-host feed subscription toggles for the aggregated multi-host For-You feed. `hostId` segment charset `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` (dotted host ids are inexpressible in dotted keys and reject as unknown); the flat toggle tails + `enabled` are RESERVED segments in both spellings, so a host id can never shadow a flat key. No env-var mapping for the dynamic class in v1 — file/API only. The CLI config store carries the same class (parity-pinned against the daemon store).

Precedence:
- CLI flag
- environment variable
- config file
- default

Notes:
- `--with-source` (top-level) and `--show-source` (`get`) report per-key source/default for honest provenance.
- `init-workspace` additively scaffolds `missions/`, `exhaust/`, `SPEC.md`, `project.yaml`, `workspace.yaml`, and `.gitignore` at `~/.openrig/workspace/` (or the `--root` override). `--dry-run` previews without writing. `--force` is deprecated compatibility and preserves existing files. New in v0.3.0.
- `snapshots.periodic.*` (v0.3.4): the daemon-side scheduler takes periodic snapshots per rig at `interval_seconds` and retains the newest `retention_keep`. At restore time, newest-wins between `auto-periodic` and `auto-pre-down` snapshots.

Legacy env compatibility: the original runtime keys still accept deprecated
`RIGGED_*` aliases. New typed config keys use `OPENRIG_*` only.

### `rig auth`

Manage agent auth profiles. The command is **CLI-local** — it never touches the daemon, so a token
value never enters the daemon queue, stream, database, or logs. The runtime is an orthogonal axis via
`--runtime` (MVP: `codex`, also the default), modeled on `gh auth switch/status` and `aws --profile` /
`kubectl config use-context`. It is deliberately NOT `rig codex-auth` and NOT a `rig codex` vendor-noun
family — the harness is a flag, not a command noun (see `conventions/cli-read-command-grammar`).

Usage:
- `rig auth status [--runtime codex]` — auth-file presence, file mode, saved-profile count, and login
  state. **No secrets**: login state is derived from the runtime CLI's exit code only, never its output.
- `rig auth list [--runtime codex]` — saved profile names.
- `rig auth save <profile> [--runtime codex]` — snapshot the active auth file into a named profile (a
  mode-guarded byte copy; contents are never read into or echoed by the command).
- `rig auth switch <profile> [--runtime codex]` — activate a saved profile (copy it onto the active
  auth file at `0600`).
- `rig auth validate <profile> [--runtime codex]` — check a profile's file mode + JSON parseability.
  This is **not** a live-auth check; a parse failure reports a fixed reason, never the file content.
- `rig auth seats list|show <seat>|set …|report [--runtime codex]` — a per-operator seat → profile
  **metadata** registry.

Profile storage:
- `CODEX_HOME` (default `$HOME/.codex`, env-overridable) holds the active `auth.json`, the
  `auth-profiles/` directory (profiles `0600`, directory `0700`), and `auth-seat-registry.tsv`.
- Ships **empty**: no example or bundled profiles/registry. Profile names use a strict whitelist
  (alnum-led `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, ≤64 chars); symlinked or out-of-tree profile paths are refused.

Secret + honesty invariants:
- **No token value is ever printed, logged, queued, streamed, or committed.** `status`/`validate`
  report presence/mode/parseability/login-state only.
- **Seat-registry labels are metadata, not proof of a live account.** A seat labeled with profile "X"
  does not prove a running session is actually using that account; the command output states this. The
  registry stores no token/resume secret — its columns are `seat / rig / runtime / cwd / auth_profile /
  updated_ts`.

Note: live runtime sessions do not switch accounts in place — restart the affected seats to pick up a
newly switched profile.

### `rig preflight`

Usage: `rig preflight [--json]`

Notes:
- Runs system readiness checks from local configuration.
- On failure, prints what failed, why it matters, and how to fix it.

### `rig doctor`

Usage: `rig doctor [--json]`

Notes:
- Verifies install health for packaged/local CLI usage.
- Checks daemon dist, UI dist, Node version, `tmux`, optional `cmux` control health, writable state paths, and daemon port availability.
- On macOS, also warns when tmux mouse mode appears disabled, gives the current-server fix (`tmux set -g mouse on`), and points to the persistent fix in `~/.tmux.conf`.
- `cmux` issues are warnings, not hard failures. OpenRig still works without `cmux`; only `Open CMUX` workflows are unavailable.
- `--json` is suitable for agent use and only exits non-zero on real failures, not warnings.

### `rig destroy`

Usage:
- `rig destroy --state [--backup] --yes --confirm destroy-openrig-state`
- `rig destroy --all [--backup] --yes --confirm destroy-openrig-state`

Notes:
- This is the destructive recovery surface for polluted local OpenRig state.
- `--state` stops the daemon, clears the active OpenRig listener on the configured port if needed, rotates or deletes the effective state root, and recreates an empty state root.
- `--all` includes `--state` plus managed tmux session cleanup for sessions that are discoverable from the current OpenRig database.
- `--backup` moves the state root aside to a collision-safe timestamped path such as `~/.openrig.backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.
- Managed tmux cleanup is intentionally conservative. It only removes sessions that are present in current DB state; unrelated tmux sessions are left alone.
- Human output prints a compact destroy plan followed by the destroy result.

### `rig start`

Usage:
- `rig start` (interactive: daemon + kernel + pick-and-restore)
- `rig start --last [--json]` (headless: restore rigs that were last running)
- `rig start --all [--json]` (headless: restore all rigs with restore-usable snapshots)
- `rig start --rigs <name> [<name>...] [--json]` (headless: restore only the named rigs)

Notes:
- Recovery entrypoint introduced in v0.3.4 (slice 01). Sequencing-only: composes daemon start + kernel auto-boot wait + per-rig restore primitives; re-codes nothing.
- NOT the getting-started boot hero — that remains `rig up <starter>`. `rig start` is for post-reboot/crash recovery.
- TTY interactive flow lists last-running candidates with a readiness summary (`[ready to resume]`, `[will ask before fresh]`, `[fresh start]`, `[mixed]`), then offers restore-all or a spacebar multi-select picker.
- Headless modes (`--last`, `--all`, `--rigs`) take zero prompts; if a node returns `awaiting-decision`, the CLI reports it honestly and prints the `rig up --existing <rig> --fresh <logicalId>` command to take action.
- Surface source-verified against `packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts` at `03a5f915` (v0.3.4).

### `rig mcp`

Usage: `rig mcp serve [--port <port>]`

Subcommands:
- `serve`

Shipped MCP tools:
- `rig_up`
- `rig_down`
- `rig_ps`
- `rig_status`
- `rig_snapshot_create`
- `rig_snapshot_list`
- `rig_restore`
- `rig_discover`
- `rig_bind`
- `rig_bundle_inspect`
- `rig_agent_validate`
- `rig_rig_validate`
- `rig_rig_nodes`
- `rig_send`
- `rig_capture`
- `rig_chatroom_send`
- `rig_chatroom_watch`

## Rig Lifecycle and Specs

### `rig bootstrap`

Usage: `rig bootstrap <spec> [--plan] [--yes] [--json]`

Arguments:
- `spec`: path to a rig spec YAML file or a library name

Notes:
- Bare names resolve through the spec library before falling back to the raw source value.

### `rig requirements`

Usage: `rig requirements <spec> [--json]`

Arguments:
- `spec`: path to a rig spec YAML file

Notes:
- `rig requirements` is the spec/app-specific dependency surface.
- Use `rig doctor` for host-level install health, then `rig requirements <spec>` for rig-specific requirements.

### `rig up`

Usage: `rig up <source> [--plan] [--yes] [--cwd <path>] [--target <root>] [--existing] [--fresh <seats...>] [--json]`

Arguments:
- `source`: path to `.yaml` or `.rigbundle`, or a bare name

Actual source resolution:
- Absolute/relative YAML path: boot from that spec
- `.rigbundle` path: install/bootstrap from that bundle
- Bare name without slash/extension:
  - first checks the spec library
  - if no library match, treats it as an existing rig restore/power-on target
  - if both a library spec and existing rig share the same name, exits with an ambiguity error

Current behavior notes:
- `--cwd <path>` overrides launch working directory for all members for this run only. For path-form `rig up <install-internal-spec>` invocations the CLI defaults `cwd` to the caller's directory (slice-22 Bug 3) so library specs match path-form behavior.
- `--target <root>` is only for bundle/package installation. It does not override agent working directories.
- `--existing` skips the library-spec name resolution and treats `<source>` as an existing rig name directly (disambiguates when a library spec and a stopped rig share the same name).
- `--plan` previews the restore without executing (read-only). The preview honors an honest async timeout and reports per-node intended action.
- `--fresh <seats...>` deliberately fresh-primes the named seats (logical ids) instead of resuming their original sessions (operation B); reported in the per-node status vocabulary as `fresh-primed`. Repeatable: `--fresh seat-a --fresh seat-b` or `--fresh seat-a seat-b`.
- `local:` `agent_ref` values resolve relative to the rig spec directory, not the caller shell cwd.
- If you copy a built-in spec to a new directory, keep its `agents/` tree beside it or rewrite those refs to `path:/absolute/path`.
- Managed apps are first-class `up` targets. `rig up secrets-manager` launches the shipped Vault example from the library.
- **`rig up factory-rsi` (OPR.0.4.6.FAC2)** launches the single-rig recursive-self-improvement factory MVP starter — seven seats (`plan`/`build`/`check`/`review`/`dogfood`/`release`/`orch`) that run the `factory-rsi` builtin workflow (inner loop plan→build→check→review→release); the dogfood seat runs out-of-band against the shipped product and feeds its findings back into the next plan. Workspace-agnostic: `rig up factory-rsi --cwd <repo>` points the loop at the repo to improve.
- v0.3.2 paper-cut fix-round (slice-22): pre-launch failures now return structured HTTP 4xx (`cycle_error` / `preflight_failed` / `validation_failed` / `service_boot_failed`) instead of bare 500; failed boots no longer leave orphan rig records on disk.
- **v0.4.4 (OPR.0.4.4.11) — whole-topology sources**: a `.rigtopology` manifest (or a YAML file whose body declares the topology form) boots MULTIPLE rigs in one staged spin-up. v0 manifest entries are **spec paths only** (a closed-key manifest: `.rigbundle` and bare library-name entries are rejected at parse time with per-entry what/why/fix naming the v0 boundary). Per-entry `host: <id>` is the ONLY placement mechanism for topology entries — `rig up --host <id> <topology>` is REJECTED pre-dispatch (two placement mechanisms must not coexist). The launcher acquires per-rig launch locks route-side and reports a CLOSED per-entry aggregate `{ok | failed | skipped}` (skipped is explicit — a lock conflict or upstream failure never reads as silent success). Source: `packages/cli/src/commands/up.ts` (`.rigtopology` sniff + `--host` rejection), `packages/daemon/src/domain/topology/{topology-manifest,multi-rig-launcher,remote-up-leaf}.ts`, `packages/daemon/src/routes/up.ts`.
- v0.3.4: `rig up` is resume-original-by-default for existing rigs. Per-seat opt-in to deliberate fresh-prime is via `--fresh <seats...>`. The five-term restore status vocabulary surfaced per-node is `resumed` / `fresh-primed` / `awaiting-decision` / `attention_required` / `failed`. On TTY, `awaiting-decision` nodes trigger an interactive [y/N] ASK; in headless mode they are reported honestly with the exact `rig up --existing <rig> --fresh <logicalId>` follow-up command.

Success modes:
- fresh boot
- restored existing rig
- partial boot (non-zero exit)

### `rig down`

Usage: `rig down <rig> [--delete] [--force] [--snapshot] [--json]`

`<rig>` accepts a rig **name or id**, symmetric with `rig up`. A name is
resolved to its id via the active (non-archived) rig summary before teardown.

Flags:
- `--delete`: delete the rig record after teardown
- `--force`: kill sessions immediately
- `--snapshot`: take a snapshot before teardown

Notes:
- When `--snapshot` succeeds, human output includes the restore command.
- If the rig name is uniquely reusable, the handoff prefers `rig up <rigName>`.
- Destructive-op safety: if a name matches more than one rig, `rig down`
  refuses to tear down any of them and lists the matching ids - re-run with
  `rig down <id>`. An id always resolves directly (ids are never ambiguous).

### `rig archive`

Usage: `rig archive <rigId> [--force] [--json]`

Flags:
- `--force`: archive even if the rig is running or degraded
- `--json`: JSON output for agents

Notes:
- Soft, reversible archive: hides the rig from the default explorer and `rig ps`, while retaining the rig record, topology, and snapshots.
- Different from `rig down --delete` (delete is destructive; archive is recoverable).
- Archived rigs are hidden from default `rig ps`; use `rig ps --include-archived` to see them.
- Archiving a running or degraded rig requires `--force`; without it the call returns HTTP `409` with a three-part honest error and exits `2`.
- Reverse with `rig unarchive <rigId>`.
- Emits `rig.archived` SSE event.
- Surface source-verified against `packages/cli/src/commands/archive.ts` at `53794fbe` (v0.3.3).

### `rig unarchive`

Usage: `rig unarchive <rigId> [--json]`

Notes:
- Reverse of `rig archive`: clears the `archived_at` flag so the rig returns to the default explorer and `rig ps` view.
- Always non-destructive (the row and snapshots were retained while archived); no `--force` and no running-rig guard.
- Emits `rig.unarchived` SSE event.
- Surface source-verified against `packages/cli/src/commands/unarchive.ts` at `53794fbe` (v0.3.3).

### `rig env`

Usage:
- `rig env status <rig> [--json]`
- `rig env logs <rig> [service] [--tail <n>]`
- `rig env down <rig> [--volumes]`

Notes:
- This surface is only meaningful for service-backed rigs and managed apps.
- `status` resolves rig names or IDs and returns the env receipt with an honest freshness probe. The response includes `probeStatus` (fresh/stale/no_orchestrator) so operators can distinguish current truth from cached state.
- `logs` proxies compose-backed service logs; `[service]` is optional.
- `down` tears down the rig environment. `--volumes` overrides the stored down policy to force volume removal via `docker compose down --volumes`.
- Note: `rig ps` does not yet surface env health. Runtime env truth is available through `rig env status` and the rig drawer `Env` tab.

### `rig ps`

Usage:
- `rig ps [--json] [--full] [--rig <name>] [-A | --all-rigs] [--session <sess>] [--limit <n>] [--fields <list>] [--summary] [--filter <key=value>] [--host <id>]`
- `rig ps --nodes [--json] [--full] [--rig <name>] [-A | --all-rigs] [--session <sess>] [--limit <n>] [--fields <list>] [--summary] [--filter <key=value>] [--active] [--host <id>]`

Notes:
- **v0.4.4 — consolidated all-rigs default + disclosure ladder (OPR.0.4.4.21)**: the default is **every ACTIVE rig, one compact row each** — O(rigs), never a fleet node fan-out — plus three load-bearing display elements: the host rollup line ("N rigs · M seats · K need attention"), the archived/stopped count line (history folds to ONE line), and the affordance footer teaching the drill ladder. The v0.4.0 current-rig default is RETIRED (it hid running rigs from the operator's field of view); the session-rig default now applies ONLY to `--nodes`, and only locally — **implicit scope defaults don't cross host boundaries** (remote `--nodes` requires explicit `--rig` or `-A`). `-A`/`--all-rigs` keeps exactly ONE meaning: the `--nodes` fleet widener; bare `-A` is a structured teaching error naming `--include-archived` for history. STATED contract: default `--json` is a bare array of ALL non-archived rigs INCLUDING stopped ones (existing keys preserved; additive `attentionCount`); only the human table folds stopped rigs. Fan-out (`--all-hosts`/`--hosts`) emits the intra-P4 shared `AggregatedPayload` (hostId-stamped `items` + closed-enum per-host `hosts[]` statuses) and is rollup-only by default; the full explicit ladder (`--all-hosts --nodes -A`, `--full` for complete records) fans out per-node with hostId-stamped projected rows. Migration from the old firehose: `rig ps --nodes -A --full`. The default `--json` output is a compact TL;DR projection per node: `session`, `rig` (to disambiguate under `-A`), `activity` (state + reason), `assigned` / `pending` counts, resume summary as `resumeType` + `resumeTokenPresent` (boolean — NOT the token value, per the slice-34 security correction). `--full` returns the complete per-node record (raw byte-equivalent passthrough — preserves the prior shape including `tmuxAttachCommand`, `resumeCommand`, `contextUsage`, `agentActivity` full, `restoreOutcome`, etc.; `resumeToken` value is still part of `--full` for downstream consumers that need it). All-states stays the default (per the orch-lead-grounded ruling: ps surfaces topology/readiness, where stopped/recoverable/attention IS the actionable signal — unlike queue-list which defaults to active items only). `--active` / `--running` is the opt-in active-filter (already existed). Closes a ~77,000-token status-glance incident at root + a fleet-scale unbounded-default-output bomb.
- **Daemon node-list payload trimmed at source (slice 26)**: `recoveryGuidance` is no longer serialized as near-identical templated prose on every node — relocated to a guidance-by-reference map at the top level so the 4 current consumers still resolve it. `contextUsage` is a compact summary in the list payload (full telemetry remains retrievable per-node via `rig whoami` / detail queries). Even `--full` and the UI consumers stop paying for the redundant per-node blobs.
- `rig ps` lists rig summaries. Default human columns (v0.4.4): `RIG`, `NODES`, `RUNNING`, `ACTIVE`, `WORK`, `ATTN`, `STATUS`, `LIFECYCLE`, `UPTIME`, `SNAPSHOT`. The `LIFECYCLE` column shows the rig-level fold of per-node lifecycle states with codes `run`/`rec`/`stp`/`deg`/`att`; `ATTN` is the additive attention count.
- `rig ps --nodes` expands into the current (or `--rig`-named) rig's node inventory — `--nodes -A` for the cross-rig inventory (v0.4.4 scoping). Default human columns include `STATUS`, `STARTUP`, `LIFECYCLE`, `ACTIVITY`, `RESTORE`, `ERROR` so startup-time and live runtime state can be compared side-by-side without composing a separate diagnostic command.
- JSON output for both rig and node tiers includes a `rigName` alias (equal to `name`) for forward compatibility; agent code should prefer `rigName`. Default `--json` is a bare array (back-compat); the envelope shape `{entries, totalRigs|totalNodes, truncated, hint?}` is only used when `--limit`, `--fields`, `--summary`, or `--filter` is set.
- Default human output is bounded for context-window safety: rigs truncate at 50 with a footer naming the total + `--full` opt-out, nodes truncate at 100 with the same shape. `--full` disables truncation. `--limit <n>` sets an explicit bound.
- `--summary` emits aggregate counts only (`byStatus`, `byLifecycle` for rigs; `bySessionStatus`, `byLifecycle` for nodes); useful for quick fleet checks without per-entry detail. Cross-facet disagreement (e.g. a `running` rig with `attention_required` nodes) is not directly visible in summary mode — narrow with `--filter lifecycleState=attention_required` instead.
- `--fields <list>` projects JSON output to a comma-separated allow-list of top-level fields. Unknown keys are rejected before any HTTP call with an error naming the unknown key(s) and the sorted supported list. Exit code on rejection is `1`. Accepted (rig-level): `rigId`, `name`, `rigName`, `nodeCount`, `runningCount`, `activeCount`, `hasWorkCount`, `attentionCount`, `status`, `lifecycleState`, `uptime`, `latestSnapshot`. Accepted (node-level, with `--nodes`): `rigId`, `rigName`, `logicalId`, `podId`, `podNamespace`, `canonicalSessionName`, `nodeKind`, `runtime`, `sessionStatus`, `startupStatus`, `restoreOutcome`, `oriented`, `lifecycleState`, `tmuxAttachCommand`, `resumeCommand`, `latestError`, `terminalActive`, `hasAssignedWork`, `pendingWorkCount`, `agentActivity`, `contextUsage`, `heldReason`. `name` is rig-level only; for node entries use `rigName` (the rejection error includes a hint). Nested fields (e.g. `agentActivity.state`) are not drilled; pass the whole object name (e.g. `agentActivity`) and read the nested value downstream.
- `--filter <key=value>` accepts `status`, `lifecycleState`, `name-prefix`, `name`, and `agentActivity.state` (PL-019; node-level — use with `--nodes`). Unknown keys are rejected before any HTTP call with a clear error naming the supported list. For `agentActivity.state`, allowed values are `running`, `needs_input`, `idle`, `unknown`; invalid values fail fast with a three-part error (what failed / what's allowed / what to do).
- `--active` (PL-019; node-level) is sugar for `--filter agentActivity.state=running`. Combining `--active` with `--filter` is rejected — pick one explicit form. Output is identical to the explicit-filter form on the same fixture.
- `--host <id>` routes the same command to a remote host declared in `~/.openrig/hosts.yaml` via single-hop ssh (CLI-side shell-out; daemon untouched). Forwards every shaping flag (`--nodes`, `--full`, `--limit`, `--fields`, `--summary`, `--filter`, `--json`) to the remote `rig ps`. The remote rig's output is verbatim passthrough on success; failure is distinguished into `ssh-unreachable` / `permission-gate` / `remote-daemon-unreachable` / `remote-command-failed` per the closed cross-host execution contract.
- Exit codes:
  - `0` success
  - `1` daemon not running, or invalid `--filter` / `--limit` / `--fields`
  - `2` daemon fetch failure

### `rig snapshot`

Usage:
- `rig snapshot <rigId> [--intended-seats <ids>]`
- `rig snapshot list <rigId>`

Subcommands:
- `list <rigId>`

### `rig restore`

Usage:
- `rig restore <snapshotId> --rig <rigId>`
- `rig restore status <attemptId> --rig <rigId> [--json]`

Important:
- `--rig <rigId>` is required by the source code, even though the help text does not visually mark it as required.

Notes:
- Human output prints each restored node and any failed node error.
- Non-zero exit if any restored node fails.
- A started asynchronous restore prints its attempt id. `status` derives the
  original and current intended-set verdict, snapshot selection, historical
  exclusions, and unresolved intended seats from that durable attempt.

### `rig restore-check`

Usage: `rig restore-check [--rig <name>] [--as <session>] [--full] [--no-queue] [--no-hooks] [--json]`

Notes:
- Checks restore readiness across running rigs (or one rig with `--rig` / one seat with `--as`).
- **v0.4.0 — summary + not-ready default (slice 29)**: default output is a summary block (total seats / ready / not-ready / error-degraded counts) PLUS only the **not-ready** seats listed compactly (seat + readiness reason). `--full` (or `--json --full`) returns today's complete per-seat readiness across the fleet. The daemon skips per-seat detail assembly for ready seats when compact (computes verdict, omits detail). Closes the largest measured token bomb on the read-command surface (~79,000 tokens → low thousands).
- The summary default correctly identifies EVERY not-ready seat (no false-ready omission) — the actionable signal is lossless even though detail is dropped for ready seats.
- `--no-queue` skips queue file checks; `--no-hooks` skips hook checks.
- Exit codes: `0` restorable (or restorable with caveats), `1` not restorable (red blockers found), `2` unknown / probe error.

### `rig restore-packet`

Usage: `rig restore-packet <subcommand>`

Subcommands:
- `write [options]` — generate a restore packet from a source session or JSONL file.
- `read <packet-dir> [--json]` — render a restore packet's contents (human or JSON).
- `validate <packet-dir> [--json]` — validate a restore packet against the v0 schema.

Notes:
- Packet shape is the cross-runtime v0 standard (Claude Code and Codex transcripts both supported via runtime parsers + redaction).
- `write` emits a packet directory with the canonical schema files plus `omitted-records` accounting.
- `read` and `validate` operate on existing packet directories and do not mutate them.

### `rig export`

Usage: `rig export <rigId> [-o|--output <path>]`

Default output path:
- `rig.yaml`

### `rig import`

Usage:
- `rig import <path> [--instantiate] [--materialize-only] [--preflight] [--target-rig <rigId>] [--rig-root <root>]`

Notes:
- Accepts YAML rig specs.
- `--target-rig` is additive materialization into an existing rig.
- `--rig-root` is used for pod-aware resolution.

### `rig bundle`

Usage: `rig bundle <subcommand>`

Subcommands:
- `create <spec> -o <path> [--name <name>] [--bundle-version <ver>] [--include-packages <refs...>] [--rig-root <root>] [--notes <text>] [--min-daemon-version <ver>] [--min-cli-version <ver>] [--json]` — pack a rig spec + its declared content into a `.rigbundle`. v0.3.2 slice-05 ships first-class cross-primitive bundling: skills + plugins (hybrid) + workflow_specs + context_packs + agent_images vendor end-to-end with both-sides path containment, symlink escape protection, and integrity hashing.
- `inspect <path> [--json]` — inspect a `.rigbundle` manifest. v0.3.2 surfaces the cross-primitive content fields as first-class.
- `install <path> [--plan] [--yes] [--target <root>] [--skip-version-check] [--force] [--json]` — install a `.rigbundle`. Routes each declared content kind to its canonical library under `$OPENRIG_HOME`. `--skip-version-check` is an operator-explicit override of the install-time daemon/CLI compatibility gate (NOT recommended). `--force` is an operator-explicit override of the install-time conflict check (NOT recommended; conflicts may produce partial install state).
- `history [--rig <name>] [--since <iso>] [--json]` — list bundle install audit records from `~/.openrig/bundle-audit.jsonl`. Filters by target rig name and earliest `installedAt`.

Important:
- `bundle create` requires `-o, --output <path>` by source definition.
- v0.3.2 install timeout bumped (was 5s — too short for tmux-session-bootstrapping installs).
- Deferred to 0.3.3 (per release packet): agent/port/managed-app collision detection (Item 4.3), broader install-into-existing-rig pathway acceptance (Item 4.4), and the `--target-name` CLI flag (slice-05 Item-3 sub-scopes; design-contingent on CLI surface decision).

### `rig package` (legacy)

Usage: `rig package <subcommand>`

Subcommands:
- `validate <path>`
- `plan <path> [--target <dir>] [--runtime <runtime>] [--role <name>]`
- `install <path> [--target <dir>] [--runtime <runtime>] [--role <name>] [--allow-merge]`
- `rollback <installId>`
- `list`

Notes:
- The package surface is explicitly marked legacy in the shipped CLI.

### `rig spec`

Usage: `rig spec <subcommand>`

Subcommands:
- `validate <path> [--json]`
- `preflight <path> [--rig-root <root>] [--json]`

### `rig agent`

Usage: `rig agent validate <path> [--json]`

Subcommands:
- `validate <path>`

### `rig specs`

Usage: `rig specs <subcommand>`

Subcommands:
- `ls [--kind <kind>] [--json]`
- `show <name-or-id> [--json]`
- `preview <name-or-id> [--json]`
- `add <path> [--json]`
- `sync [--json]`
- `remove <name-or-id> [--json]`
- `rename <name-or-id> <new-name> [--json]`

Notes:
- `specs` is the library surface for rigs, agents, and managed apps.
- `preview` returns structured review data from the daemon.
- `add` accepts either a YAML spec file or a full spec directory containing `rig.yaml` or `agent.yaml`.
- Directory adds copy the whole tree into the user library so adjacent agents, guidance, skills, and docs remain available.
- `preview secrets-manager` is the canonical managed-app review example.

## Discovery and Topology Mutation

### `rig discover`

Usage: `rig discover [--json] [--draft]`

Notes:
- Scans unmanaged tmux sessions.
- `--draft` generates a candidate rig spec from the discovery set.

### `rig attach`

Usage:
- `rig attach --self --rig <rigId> --node <logicalId> [--cwd <path>] [--display-name <name>] [--print-env] [--json]`
- `rig attach --self --rig <rigId> --pod <namespace> --member <name> --runtime <runtime> [--cwd <path>] [--display-name <name>] [--print-env] [--json]`

Notes:
- `--self` is currently required.
- Node attach and pod-create attach are exclusive modes.
- In tmux-backed shells, the command records tmux attachment metadata; otherwise it records an `external_cli` attachment.
- `--print-env` prints shell exports for `OPENRIG_NODE_ID` and `OPENRIG_SESSION_NAME`.

### `rig bind`

Usage: `rig bind <discoveredId> --rig <rigId> (--node <logicalId> | --pod <namespace> --member <name>)`

Important:
- `--rig <rigId>` is required.
- Binding mode is exclusive:
  - existing node: `--node <logicalId>`
  - create new node: `--pod <namespace> --member <name>`

### `rig adopt`

Usage:
- `rig adopt <path> --bind <logicalId=tmuxSessionOrDiscoveryId> [--bind ...] [--target-rig <rigId>] [--rig-root <root>] [--json]`

Important:
- `--bind` is required and repeatable.
- The input file must be a pod-aware RigSpec with `pods`.

Notes:
- Materializes the topology first, then resolves/binds discovered sessions.
- In JSON mode, emits the materialized nodes plus binding results.

### `rig reconcile-session`

Usage:
- `rig reconcile-session <session> [--rig <rigId>] [--node <logicalId>] [--no-launch] [--json]`

Arguments:
- `session`: canonical session name (e.g. `dev-impl@my-rig`) of the LIVE session to adopt.

Flags:
- `--rig` and `--node` are paired disambiguators (both required together) when the session resolves ambiguously.
- `--no-launch` is the only mode this command has; accepted for explicitness.

Notes:
- No-launch, no-input adopt of a hand-resumed canonical session (slice 03 / v0.3.4). The operator already resumed the session externally (e.g. `claude --resume`, `codex resume`) inside its canonical tmux session; the daemon still shows the seat down.
- Binds the live process to its OWN persisted node (same node id, no re-key) and updates the projection so `rig ps` / topology / send / capture / queue routing work again.
- NEVER launches, relaunches, kills, replays startup, presses resume menus, compacts, or types into the pane.
- Anything that could not be proven is reported as projection drift; conversation continuity is never claimed.
- Surface source-verified against `packages/cli/src/commands/reconcile-session.ts` at `03a5f915` (v0.3.4).

### `rig expand`

Usage: `rig expand <rig-id> <pod-fragment-path> [--json] [--rig-root <path>]`

Notes:
- Adds a pod fragment to a running rig.
- `--rig-root` controls agent resolution.
- Member YAML may carry `session_source` (see "Session source declaration" below) to start the new seat from a prior native conversation (`mode: fork`) or from operator-declared artifacts (`mode: rebuild`).

### `rig add`

Usage: `rig add <rig-id> <pod-namespace> <member-fragment-path> [--json] [--rig-root <path>]`

Arguments:
- `<rig-id>`: id of the target rig
- `<pod-namespace>`: namespace of the existing pod to add the member to
- `<member-fragment-path>`: path to a YAML/JSON member-fragment file (spec snake_case fields)

Notes:
- The `add_member` converge op verb: adds a member to an existing pod in a running rig from a YAML/JSON member-fragment file.
- Member fragment accepts both the bare form (top-level member fields) and the wrapper form (`{ member: {...}, edges?: [...] }`). A top-level `edges:` field in the bare form is lifted as pod-local edges and is NOT silently dropped.
- **OPR.0.4.6.FAC1**: the fragment accepts an optional `role: <name>` (charset `A-Za-z0-9_.-`; rejected on `runtime: terminal`). A role-declared seat becomes eligible for workflow role→seat capability resolution on this rig — scale-out = add a member under the role (this verb IS the growth path). Role is opt-in per seat: a role-less member stays reachable only via explicit `preferred_targets`; a PROVIDED role is validated, never silently dropped.
- A present-but-non-array `edges` field is rejected with an honest error (no silent drop).
- `--rig-root <path>` controls agent resolution.
- HTTP outcomes: `201` on success (with the new node + persisted edges + optional warnings); `409 member_conflict`; `400 validation_failed` / `preflight_failed`; `404 pod_not_found` (lists existing pods).
- Exit code is non-zero if the HTTP call failed OR the new node did not fully launch (`status !== "launched"`).
- Surface source-verified against `packages/cli/src/commands/add.ts` at `53794fbe` (v0.3.3).

### Session source declaration (`session_source`)

Member YAML in a rig spec or `rig expand` payload may declare a launch-time `session_source` to control how the new managed seat derives its starting context. Two modes are supported in v1:

```yaml
# Fork from a prior native runtime conversation. Captures and persists a NEW
# post-fork token; the parent token is NEVER persisted onto the new seat.
members:
  - id: reviewer-2
    runtime: claude-code        # or "codex"; not valid on terminal
    session_source:
      mode: fork
      ref:
        kind: native_id         # v1 fork mode supports "native_id" only
        value: "0b0165d7-cb4d-4650-90de-15c0a1ede9e6"
```

```yaml
# Rebuild from operator-declared artifacts (CULTURE, role doc, handover packet,
# queue files, session logs). Fresh-launches the harness and seeds the running
# TUI with the artifacts in the operator-declared trust-precedence order.
# The seat's continuityOutcome is `rebuilt` (NEVER `fresh`/`resumed`/`forked`)
# and NO `resumeToken` is persisted.
members:
  - id: writer-2
    runtime: claude-code        # or "codex"; not valid on terminal
    session_source:
      mode: rebuild
      ref:
        kind: artifact_set      # v1 rebuild mode supports "artifact_set" only
        value:                  # ordered list, highest-trust first
          - <substrate-shared-docs>/rigs/<rig>/CULTURE.md
          - <substrate-shared-docs>/specs/agents/<role>.md
          - /path/to/handover-packet.md
          - /path/to/state/<pod>/<member>.queue.md
          - /path/to/state/<pod>/shared.session.log
          - /path/to/state/<pod>/<member>.session.log
```

Notes:
- `terminal` runtime rejects `session_source` (no native fork primitive; no agent context to rebuild).
- `mode: fork` requires `ref.kind: native_id` and a non-empty `ref.value` string. Other ref kinds (`artifact_path`, `name`, `last`) are reserved shapes for follow-up slices and are refused in v1 fork mode.
- `mode: rebuild` requires `ref.kind: artifact_set` and a non-empty `ref.value` array of paths. Missing paths are recorded as gaps and the launch proceeds with what resolved; if NO declared paths resolve, the launch fails with a clear error.
- The two modes are mutually exclusive on a given member; mixing is a schema error.

### `rig unclaim`

Usage: `rig unclaim <sessionRef> [--json]`

Notes:
- Releases an adopted session without killing its tmux session.

### `rig release`

Usage: `rig release <rigId> [--delete] [--json]`

Notes:
- Releases all claimed/adopted sessions from a rig without killing their tmux sessions.
- `--delete` removes the rig record after a clean release.
- OpenRig-launched nodes still require `rig down`.

### `rig launch`

Usage: `rig launch <rigId> [nodeRef] [--seats <ids>] [--hold-reason <reason>] [--snapshot-id <id>] [--plan] [--json]`

Notes:
- Launches or relaunches a node in a running rig.
- `nodeRef` (optional) can be a logical ID or node ID for the single-target form.
- `--seats <ids>` (v0.3.4, slice 11) takes a comma-separated list of logical IDs for node-granular managed partial restore — launch a named subset of seats while holding the rest. Retires the prior `pod_aware_launch_unsupported` dead-end.
- `--hold-reason <reason>` records the reason non-target seats are being held; surfaced via observability so the held state is auditable.
- `--snapshot-id <id>` selects one exact restore-usable snapshot instead of
  applying the automatic choice. `--plan` previews a multi-seat subset and its
  non-target effects without mutation.
- `rig launch <rigId> <nodeRef> --retry-startup-from <member-file> --rig-root <absolute-source-root>`
  explicitly retries an added agent whose first start failed during resource
  projection, before a native conversation began and before startup context was
  saved. First correct the projection failure, exit the failed shell normally,
  and use `rig seat clean <seat> --reason <reason>` after it is stopped. Supply
  the original bare or `{member: ...}` YAML/JSON fragment, without edges or
  member startup/continuity overrides. The agent source hash and retained
  identity, model, cwd and policy must agree. The retry uses normal validation,
  projection and required startup delivery on the same node; it preserves other
  seats and prior failures. It refuses bound, live, indeterminate or previously
  native sessions. This is not snapshot restore or a substitute for deliberate
  fresh launch, and cannot combine with snapshot, subset or plan options.
  The operator is responsible for supplying the complete original fragment:
  retained state cannot reconstruct missing member, pod or rig instructions.
  Never strip unsupported overrides to make a retry pass.

### `rig remove`

Usage: `rig remove <rigId> <nodeRef> [--json]`

Notes:
- Removes a single node from a running rig.

### `rig shrink`

Usage: `rig shrink <rigId> <podRef> [--json]`

Notes:
- Removes an entire pod from a running rig.
- `podRef` can be a pod namespace or pod ID.

## Identity, Communication, and Context

### `rig startup-proof submit`

Usage: `rig startup-proof submit --challenge-id <id> --answer <answer> [--json]`

Submits the selected startup exercise through the authenticated activity hook,
using the current seat's identity and the challenge supplied in its startup
prompt. A correct current answer returns `oriented: verified`; a bare
acknowledgement, wrong answer, or stale challenge fails. Startup readiness alone
does not verify orientation.

An extra exercise is opt-in through a `startup_proof` startup action with
`value: authenticated` and `idempotent: true`. Omission adds no exercise, and a
later applicable `value: none` selects lean startup. See
[startup proof selection](../reference/rig-spec.md#startup-proof-selection)
for the full authoring and restore rules. Terminal nodes receive no challenge.

### `rig whoami`

Usage: `rig whoami [--node-id <id>] [--session <name>] [--host <id>] [--full | --verbose] [--json]`

Identity resolution order:
1. `--node-id`
2. `--session`
3. `OPENRIG_NODE_ID` / `RIGGED_NODE_ID`
4. `OPENRIG_SESSION_NAME` / `RIGGED_SESSION_NAME`
5. tmux pane metadata `@rigged_node_id`
6. tmux pane metadata `@rigged_session_name`
7. raw tmux session name

Notes:
- **v0.4.0 — compact-by-default (slice 27)**: `rig whoami` and `rig whoami --json` default to identity-recovery essentials only — `identity` (rig / pod / member / sessionName / runtime / cwd / logicalId / ids), `peers` (names only: logicalId + sessionName per peer), `edges` (directional `kind` + `to.sessionName`), `transcriptPath`. Daemon skips the `contextUsageStore` lookup and `runtimeContext` build when compact is requested (also saves daemon work). The first command every agent runs on boot + every compaction-restore now costs ~192 tokens instead of ~909.
- **`--full` (alias `--verbose`)** returns today's complete payload including `contextUsage`, `commands`, `peersNote`, `runtimeContext` — byte / shape parity with the v0.3.4 default (back-compat for any consumer that reads those fields).
- The compact-default is an ALLOWLIST projection (not a denylist) — future payload fields default to `--full` and cannot silently re-bloat the every-boot path.
- If the daemon is unreachable but an identity source can still be resolved, `--json` returns a partial result instead of crashing.
- Human-readable output (compact default) shows identity + peers + edges + transcript path. `--full` adds context usage block, commands list, peersNote prose, runtimeContext.
- `peers[]` is this rig's roster excluding self (no edge filter); use `edges{}` for directional relationships and `rig ps --nodes` for node inventory including self + live state.
- In Claude Code projects, unattended `rig whoami` on boot may require the local permissions allow list to include `Bash(rig:*)`.
- `--host <id>` routes the same command to a remote host declared in `~/.openrig/hosts.yaml` via single-hop ssh (CLI-side shell-out; daemon untouched). Identity resolution happens on the REMOTE rig (each host has its own daemon + tmux + identity context); local `--node-id`/`--session`/`--full` flags are forwarded to the remote `rig whoami` invocation. The remote rig's output is verbatim passthrough on success; failure is distinguished into the same `ssh-unreachable` / `permission-gate` / `remote-daemon-unreachable` / `remote-command-failed` enum as `rig ps --host` and `rig send --host`.

### `rig transcript`

Usage: `rig transcript <session> [--tail <lines>] [--grep <pattern>] [--host <id>] [--json]`

Defaults:
- `--tail 50`

Notes:
- Reads transcript files, not pane scrollback.
- `--grep` treats the pattern as regex.
- **v0.4.6 (OPR.0.4.6.MH4)** — `--host <id>` / the `agent@rig@host` session form reads the
  transcript from a remote host, CLI-direct against that daemon's shipped
  `GET /api/transcripts/:session/tail|grep` routes (http-registered hosts only — an
  ssh-declared host is a structured transport-requirement error; there is no ssh path for this
  verb). Output shape is the origin's, verbatim, under the `[via host=…]` banner. Precedence:
  explicit `--host` > target sugar > the persisted host selection. See "Cross-host execution".

### `rig send`

Usage: `rig send <session> [<text>] [--context <ref>] [--verify] [--force] [--raw] [--dangerously-interact --reason <text>] [--wait-for-idle <s>] [--from <session>] [--host <id>] [--json]`

Notes:
- Uses the two-step send pattern automatically: paste text, wait, submit Enter.
- `--verify` requests delivery verification.
- The default path refuses to send ONLY on positive evidence that the target is at an interactive prompt / permission block. This closes the footgun where a peer message blindly submits another agent's open prompt. When the target's activity cannot be determined (unknown, missing, or stale telemetry), the send PROCEEDS with an advisory note — telemetry is advisory, not authority over whether agents can communicate. Use `--wait-for-idle` to send only after explicit idle evidence.
- A mid-task/busy target sends-with-advisory by default (busy is not a block). `--force` is a back-compat no-op and never bypasses the interactive-prompt/permission guard.
- `--raw` sends exact text/keystrokes without the From/To messaging envelope; still guarded against interactive prompts.
- `--context <ref>` resolves one path-like context ref and delivers its whole content on a local single-seat send. Missing members abort before delivery; oversized content emits a `rig walk` advisory. It is not supported with `--host`, cross-host target sugar, or fan-out targeting.
- `--dangerously-interact` is the ONLY override of the prompt/permission guard — it deliberately drives an interactive prompt/permission block (e.g. selects an option). It implies `--raw`, requires `--reason <text>`, and is recorded in the audit log. Cannot be combined with `--wait-for-idle`.
- `--reason <text>` records why the prompt is being driven (required with `--dangerously-interact`).
- `--host <id>` sends on a remote host declared in `~/.openrig/hosts.yaml`; see "Cross-host execution" below. **v0.4.6 (OPR.0.4.6.MH4)** — the host entry's transport decides the path: ssh hosts keep the single-hop ssh shell-out byte-verbatim (SSH success is NOT verify success — the remote rig's `Verified: yes/no` is what counts and is surfaced verbatim); http hosts (e.g. pair-registered) go CLI-direct to the remote daemon's `POST /api/transport/send` with the same body a local send posts (wrap parity by construction) — `--verify` prints the REMOTE route's `verified`/`outcome` verbatim, never a locally synthesized verdict. The `agent@rig@host` target form is sugar for `--host` when the suffix is a REGISTERED host id (explicit `--host` > sugar > persisted selection; a conflict between `--host` and the sugar is a structured error).

### `rig capture`

Usage:
- `rig capture <session> [--lines <n>] [--host <id>] [--json]`
- `rig capture --rig <name> [--lines <n>] [--host <id>] [--json]`
- `rig capture --pod <name> --rig <name> [--lines <n>] [--host <id>] [--json]`

Default:
- `--lines 20`

Notes:
- `--host <id>` captures on a remote host declared in `~/.openrig/hosts.yaml`; see "Cross-host execution" below. **v0.4.6 (OPR.0.4.6.MH4)** — ssh hosts keep the shell-out verbatim; http hosts go CLI-direct to the remote daemon's `POST /api/transport/capture` with the local body shape (lines/rig/pod/session), rendering single/multi results exactly as a local capture under the `[via host=…]` banner. The `agent@rig@host` session form is sugar for `--host` when the suffix is a REGISTERED host id (`--rig`/`--pod` values are names, never sugar-parsed).

### `rig walk`

Usage: `rig walk <seat> --through <ref | files...> [--pace <duration>] [--json]`

Notes:
- `--through` accepts either one path-like context ref or an ordered list of existing local files; mixing the two forms is rejected.
- Sends one piece at a time through the normal transport and waits `--pace` between pieces (default `10s`; duration overrides require an explicit `ms` or `s` suffix). The same explicit-unit grammar applies to `--consume-timeout`, `--consume-poll`, and `--turn-timeout`; bare numbers are refused. There is no trailing delay.
- A missing local file or missing/unreadable ref member aborts before the first send, so a walk delivers every piece or none.
- Where a generation record resolves, each piece must appear as a complete user message in the newly appended record and its corresponding native turn must close before the next piece. Only CRLF line endings and surrounding whitespace are normalized; internal whitespace, missing middles, shared prefixes, and tails do not qualify.
- Claude closure follows the message's UUID ancestry through an assistant response to `turn_duration`. Codex uses a `response_item` user message within a named `task_started`/`task_complete` turn; queued input or a different turn's completion is insufficient. These receipts prove delivery and turn completion, not semantic comprehension.
- Codex generation lookup joins the bound process's post-start log thread IDs to retained native CLI conversations. Auxiliary title threads cannot replace that identity; zero or multiple matching conversations remain unverified instead of being selected by recency.
- Codex records resolve through the verified current pane/process and native thread table, including before token telemetry exists. The rollout header must identify that thread. Missing or ambiguous identity is reported as unverified. A generation/file replacement or unreadable record during a verified walk aborts it; it never silently continues into a replacement occupant.
- `--json` reports `consumptionVerified`. If the initial generation-record probe is unavailable, legacy delivery remains possible with an explicit unverified advisory and `consumptionVerified: false`.

### Cross-host execution (`--host <id>`)

Cross-host commands route to a remote host declared by id. SSH-transport
commands use single-hop SSH CLI-side shell-out; HTTP-transport commands talk to
the remote daemon API. The local daemon is not involved in SSH routing. The
remote host is expected to have its own managed `rig` available on `$PATH`.

HTTP sender attribution uses the originating instance's persisted self-host
identity, read without creating or changing its database. Explicit DB config
wins; otherwise the last daemon launch's DB selection is retained. This works
while the local daemon is stopped. The destination's identity and the configured
display name are never used as the origin.

Ordinary local requests retain bare seat names. For an explicit `OPENRIG_URL`
(or legacy `RIGGED_URL`), a bounded health probe preserves bare addressing only
when the target's self-host identity matches the local one. A different,
unavailable, or ambiguous target—including a loopback forwarding endpoint—gets
the known origin suffix. Already-qualified senders remain unchanged. If the
local origin cannot be read, delivery proceeds with `origin-unknown:v1`
provenance and a diagnostic after a successful response; queue forwarding
preserves that uncertainty rather than attributing the sender to the relay.

Hosts are declared by the operator in `~/.openrig/hosts.yaml`:

```yaml
hosts:
  - id: vm-claude-test
    transport: ssh
    target: vm-claude-test.local
    user: your-username  # optional
    notes: "test VM"     # optional
  - id: factory-http
    transport: http
    url: http://100.64.1.2:7433
    bearer_env: FACTORY_HTTP_TOKEN
```

Validation rules:

- `hosts` is required and must be a non-null array.
- Each entry: `id` required (non-empty, unique), `transport` required (`ssh` or `http`).
- SSH entries require `target` (non-empty — DNS name, SSH config alias, or IP); `user` and `notes` are optional.
- HTTP entries require `url`; a bearer pointer (`bearer_env` or `bearer_file`) is OPTIONAL — omit both for an anonymous/tokenless daemon (no `Authorization` header is sent; host+VM are one founder-owned trust domain and the mesh is the auth boundary). At most one bearer pointer may be set, never both. Pointers are config names/paths, never resolved token values; a configured-but-unresolvable pointer is a permission failure before any request.
- `rig host add/list/doctor` covers the standard path; hand-editing remains the path for exotica.
- A missing or invalid file returns a clear error pointing at the canonical path.

The CLI distinguishes four structured failure modes (operators get an
actionable error per mode; JSON output preserves the `failedStep` enum):

- `ssh-unreachable` — SSH itself failed (connection refused, host key mismatch, etc.). Verify SSH access and the registry entry.
- `permission-gate` — SSH hit an auth/permission gate (Permission denied, Keychain). The error includes a hint to the keychain-over-SSH field note.
- `remote-daemon-unreachable` — SSH succeeded but the remote `rig` reported the remote daemon was not reachable. Start it with `ssh <target> rig daemon start`.
- `remote-command-failed` — SSH succeeded but the remote `rig` exited non-zero for some other reason; the remote stderr is surfaced.

**The transport posture (OPR.0.4.4.13 FR-4 — DECIDED, pm-ruled: document, no parity).** The
partition is the intended posture, not an accident of history: **ssh carries interactive pane
ops, http carries daemon REST ops, `ps`/`whoami` follow the host's DECLARED transport.**
There is NO cross-transport fallback, and NO http parity for `send`/`capture` ships in 0.4.4
(parity would be new attack surface with no scope-locked need). **v0.4.6 UPDATE (OPR.0.4.6.MH4,
pm-RULED IN as fulfilling-confirmed-intent):** `send`/`capture` gain the http branch — the
founder's `pair` front door registers HTTP hosts, and without the branch a pair-registered demo
host could not receive send/capture at all. The mechanism is CLI-DIRECT via the shipped
`runRemoteHttpOp` to the remote daemon's EXISTING transport routes (zero daemon-side changes;
the ssh path is kept byte-verbatim for ssh hosts — coverage, not a rewrite, and still no
cross-transport fallback: the host entry's declared transport dictates the path). `transcript`
and `broadcast` gain their first cross-host affordance the same way (http-only — there is no
ssh path for them). Per-command:

| Command | ssh transport | http transport | Fan-out (`--all-hosts`/`--hosts`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rig send` | ✓ (shell-out, byte-verbatim) | ✓ (v0.4.6 MH-4 — CLI-direct `POST /api/transport/send`) | ✗ |
| `rig capture` | ✓ (shell-out, byte-verbatim) | ✓ (v0.4.6 MH-4 — CLI-direct `POST /api/transport/capture`) | ✗ |
| `rig transcript --host` (v0.4.6, OPR.0.4.6.MH4) | ✗ (structured transport error) | ✓ (CLI-direct `GET /api/transcripts/:session/tail\|grep`) | ✗ |
| `rig broadcast --host` (v0.4.6, OPR.0.4.6.MH4) | ✗ (structured transport error) | ✓ (CLI-direct `POST /api/transport/broadcast`; remote fan-out, per-target passthrough) | ✗ |
| `rig up` / `rig down` / `rig launch` | ✗ | ✓ (http-ONLY) | ✗ |
| `rig file copy` (v0.4.4) | ✓ (ssh-ONLY, rsync-over-ssh) | ✗ | ✗ |
| `rig ps --host` | ✓ (declared) | ✓ (declared) | http-only; non-http hosts appear as STRUCTURED `unsupported-transport` statuses in `hosts[]` |
| `rig whoami --host` | ✓ (declared) | ✓ (declared) | http-only; non-http hosts are currently SILENTLY FILTERED from the fan-out (a shipped gap, routed for 0.4.5 triage — differs from ps's structured status) |
| `rig host doctor` | ✓ | ✓ | n/a (single host) |
| `rig queue create/handoff/handoff-and-complete --host` (v0.4.6, OPR.0.4.6.MH3) | ✗ | ✓ (http-ONLY, daemon→daemon forward — an ssh-declared host is a structured `unsupported-transport` error) | ✗ |

Out of scope in 0.4.4: cross-transport fallback; http parity for `send`/`capture` *(shipped in
0.4.6 — OPR.0.4.6.MH4, pm-ruled fulfilling-confirmed-intent; see the v0.4.6 update above)*;
connection pooling; multi-hop SSH; cross-host queue routing *(shipped in 0.4.6 — OPR.0.4.6.MH3;
see `rig queue` § Cross-host queue routing)*; cross-host seat handover.

**The http branch's failure taxonomy (v0.4.6 — OPR.0.4.6.MH4).** The http branch names its OWN
steps (never the ssh enum, never a generic "failed"): registry-load-failed / unknown-host (the
same class across all four verbs) / `permission-gate` (bearer resolution failed locally, or the
remote returned 401/403 — including the terminal-bearer posture below) / `remote-daemon-unreachable`
(network/timeout) / `remote-command-failed` (remote 4xx/5xx, with the remote route's own error
text surfaced beside the step). **Terminal-bearer posture (named, v0 — applies to
`/api/transport/*` ONLY, i.e. send/capture/broadcast):** the remote's transport routes gate on
ITS terminal bearer class, while the CLI presents the host's REGISTRY bearer when one is
configured; for a URL-only anonymous host the `Authorization` header is omitted. Default (no
terminal bearer) + tailnet binds = pass-through by design (the mesh is the auth boundary); a
remote enforcing a DIFFERENT terminal bearer surfaces as the structured `permission-gate` step —
remedy: set the remote's terminal bearer equal to the paired registry bearer, or rely on the
tailnet boundary. **`rig transcript --host` is NOT in this class (arch n2):** the remote's
`/api/transcripts/*` routes are the shipped UNGATED transcript-read posture (open route,
daemon-local trust boundary, route-level credential redaction as the protective primitive) — a
wrong terminal bearer that permission-gates a cross-host send does NOT gate a cross-host
transcript read; transcript keeps succeeding. A coherent transcript-read auth policy across
tail/grep/full is a named future slice per the route's own comment
(`routes/transcripts.ts`, orch decision approved-option-a), out of scope here. No new auth
machinery ships with this slice.

**Destination parse rules — the two-family contract (OPR.0.4.6.MH3, arch-ruled).** The
`agent@rig@host` three-part form is INPUT SUGAR at the CLI edge, never grammar: session strings
stay `member@rig` everywhere (BR-1), and the host always travels out-of-band. TWO parse rules
ship, per verb family, BY DESIGN — one canonical rule would either break adopted targets or
degrade queue error honesty:

| Verb family | 3-part trailing segment | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Queue coordination writes (`rig queue create/handoff/handoff-and-complete`) | **Always stripped** into the out-of-band `hostId` envelope (after the human-seat classifier) | Queue destinations are canonical-only by construction (the daemon's `validateRig` rejects any non-canonical parse), so the unconditional strip loses nothing — and a mistyped host dies loud as an unknown-HOST error instead of a misleading rig-shaped `unknown_destination_rig`. |
| Session-target interactive/observe verbs (`rig send/capture/transcript`) | **Stripped only if the segment matches a REGISTERED host id** | Interactive verbs legitimately target raw/adopted tmux session names that may contain `@`; strip-iff-registered preserves them, with the unregistered-suffix host hint keeping mistypes loud. |
| `rig broadcast` | **No sugar** — the positional is MESSAGE TEXT, never parsed as a target | Sugar-parsing a message body would corrupt text containing `@`; cross-host broadcast routes on `--host` or the persisted selection only (v0.4.6 — OPR.0.4.6.MH4). |

Both families converge on the same outcome: a mistyped host dies loud with the host named. The
`RESERVED_HOST_IDS` set (`kernel`, `host`, `local` — rejected at `rig host add`) guarantees no
registered host can ever shadow the human-seat `@kernel`/`@host` classification family.

### `rig file` (v0.4.4 — OPR.0.4.4.18)

Usage: `rig file copy <src> <dst> [--dry-run] [--json]`

Cross-host file movement over ssh/rsync — v0 ships ONE explicit verb, `copy`,
for a single file.

Operand grammar (parsed, never guessed):
- `<hostId>:<absolute-path>` = remote (the `<hostId>` must resolve in the ssh
  hosts registry; remote paths must be absolute).
- Bare path = local. A LOCAL file whose name contains a colon needs the `./`
  prefix (`./weird:name.txt`) — the grammar refuses the ambiguous form with a
  structured error instead of guessing.
- Valid shapes: local→remote, remote→local, local→local. remote→remote is not
  a v0 shape.

Semantics + safety wall (source: `packages/cli/src/lib/file-transfer.ts`):
- An existing destination is **OVERWRITTEN** (v0 copy semantics, stated) —
  preview with `--dry-run`, which prints the exact planned transfer (src, dst,
  host, files/bytes) and moves nothing.
- **Default-deny wall over live agent/credential state**: paths resolving into
  the closed deny set `~/.openrig`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.codex`, `~/.claude` — plus
  the ACTIVE `OPENRIG_HOME` and the active hosts registry file — are refused
  with a named what/why error (extension of the deny set requires a ruling,
  never a silent widening).
- Traversal is rejected on the RAW operand: a `..` path segment refuses
  BEFORE any normalization (normalization collapses `..`, so a post-normalize
  check would be dead code); remote paths are additionally restricted to a
  shell-inert charset (`A-Za-z0-9._/-` — restriction over escaping, because
  both rsync implementations in the fleet differ on quoting flags), and every
  rsync invocation pins operands behind `--` and spawns argv-style with no
  shell.
- Transport is ssh-only (see the transport-posture table above); the remote
  side uses the same ssh registry entries `rig send`/`capture` use.

### `rig host`

Usage: `rig host <add|list|doctor>` — the multi-host registry verbs (OPR.0.4.4.13; capped at
exactly these three — no edit/remove/tunnel/bootstrap verbs; hand-editing `hosts.yaml` remains
the path for exotica, and the factory bootstrap ships as
`scripts/bootstrap-product-factory-vps.sh`).

- `add --id <id> --transport <ssh|http> [--target <t> --user <u> | --url <u> [--bearer-env <n>|--bearer-file <p>]] [--notes <text>] [--json]` — writes the entry validated by the registry loader's OWN rules (add-time errors are load-time errors, verbatim; duplicate ids refused; the http bearer pointer is optional — omit both for a tokenless daemon, never both). Rewrites `hosts.yaml` canonically (hand-authored comments are not preserved).
- `list [--json]` — id/transport/target plus AUTH as a config POINTER (`env:NAME` / `file:PATH` / `ssh-key`); never a resolved secret value.
- `doctor <id> [--posture product-factory-vps] [--public-addr <ip>] [--json]` — stepwise, honest verification: transport reachability → remote `rig` binary (+version) → remote daemon health → remote identity; each failing step is a DISTINCT actionable error, and unknown host ids surface as the registry error class. `--posture` runs the ONE built-in baseline (`product-factory-vps`): every item reports pass/fail/**unknown** individually with a fix per non-pass — UNKNOWN is never pass; the public `:7433`/`:22` probes need `--public-addr` (outside vantage) and a reachable public daemon port FAILS loudly. Exit `1` on any fail.

### `rig broadcast`

Usage: `rig broadcast [<text>] [--context <ref>] [--rig <name>] [--pod <name>] [--force] [--host <id>] [--json]`

Notes:
- Without `--rig` or `--pod`, broadcasts across all running sessions in all rigs.
- `--context <ref>` resolves one path-like context ref and fans out its whole content. Missing members abort before fan-out; oversized content emits a `rig walk` advisory. It is not supported with `--host`.
- **v0.4.6 (OPR.0.4.6.MH4)** — `--host <id>` broadcasts on a remote host, CLI-direct to that
  daemon's shipped `POST /api/transport/broadcast` (http-registered hosts only; an ssh-declared
  host is a structured transport-requirement error). The REMOTE daemon resolves `--rig`/`--pod`
  on ITS topology; its per-target results print verbatim and a partial fan-out exits non-zero
  exactly as a local one. The remote call carries its own named fan-out deadline
  (`BROADCAST_REMOTE_TIMEOUT_MS`, 30s — a full per-target loop outlives the 5s read default).
  The `<text>` positional is message text and is NEVER parsed as a target, so broadcast takes
  `--host` or the persisted host selection — not the `agent@rig@host` sugar.

### `rig ask`

Usage: `rig ask <rig> <question> [--json]`

Current implementation:
- Queries `/api/ask`
- Returns:
  - the original question
  - a rig summary (`name`, `status`, `nodeCount`, `runningCount`, `uptime`)
  - evidence excerpts from transcripts
  - optional chat excerpts
  - `insufficient` flag
  - optional guidance text

Important:
- The live help description says “Search rig transcript history with a natural language question,” but the shipped behavior is broader than plain transcript grep and narrower than a topology/lifecycle synthesis layer.
- This command is a daemon-backed evidence query, not a second LLM invocation.

### `rig chatroom`

Usage: `rig chatroom <subcommand>`

Subcommands:
- `send <rig> <message> [--sender <name>]`
- `history <rig> [--topic <name>] [--after <id>] [--since <ts>] [--sender <name>] [--limit <n>] [--json]`
- `wait <rig> [--after <id>] [--topic <name>] [--sender <name>] [--timeout <seconds>] [--json]`
- `clear <rig>`
- `topic <rig> <topic-name> [--body <text>] [--sender <name>]`
- `watch <rig> [--tmux]`

Notes:
- All chatroom subcommands take the rig name as a positional argument.
- `history` filters are composable: `--sender`, `--since`, `--after`, `--topic` can be combined.
- `wait` blocks until new matching messages arrive or times out (exit 1). Same filter semantics as `history`.
- `clear` is destructive and rig-scoped. Removes all messages for that rig.
- `watch --tmux` starts a dedicated tmux watcher session.

## Coordination Primitive (PL-004 Phase A)

Two top-level commands back the SQLite-canonical coordination layer. They speak only to the daemon HTTP API; they do NOT touch the POC `rigx-stream-proto` / `rigx-queue-proto` filesystem state. POC and daemon coexist at OPERATOR level only.

### `rig stream`

Usage: `rig stream <subcommand>` — L1 append-only intake stream.

Subcommands:
- `emit --source <session> --body <text> [--format <fmt>] [--hint-destination <session>] [--hint-type <type>] [--hint-urgency <urgency>] [--hint-tags <csv>] [--interrupt] [--id <streamItemId>] [--json]`
- `list [--source <session>] [--hint-destination <session>] [--tag <tag>] [--since <iso>] [--until <iso>] [--limit <n>] [--after <sortKey>] [--include-archived] [--json]`
- `watch [--json]`
- `show <streamItemId> [--json]`
- `archive <streamItemId> [--json]`

Notes:
- `--id` is for idempotency; same id returns the same row, body of subsequent calls is ignored.
- `--tag` is exact membership in `hint_tags`, not substring matching. `--since` and `--until` are inclusive ISO timestamp bounds normalized to UTC by the daemon; list order and cursor semantics remain chronological.
- `watch` consumes the existing `/api/stream/sse` contract: the daemon's initial replay followed by live items. Human output shows timestamp, source, and body; `--json` emits one `StreamItem` object per line. It makes one connection and does not reconnect automatically.
- `archive` is soft — the row remains for audit and is excluded from `list` unless `--include-archived` is passed.

### `rig queue`

Usage: `rig queue <subcommand>` — L3 owned-work queue plus inbox/outbox.

Subcommands:
- `create --source <session> --destination <session> (--body <text> | --body-file <path> | --body-context <ref>) [--mission <id>] [--slice <id>] [--priority <p>] [--tier <t>] [--tags <csv>] [--target-repo <name>] [--host <id>] [--no-nudge] [--expires-at <iso>] [--id <qitemId>] [--json]` — `--body-context <ref>` resolves a complete context pack, snapshots that content into the qitem body, and adds a `body-context:<ref>` provenance tag; it is mutually exclusive with `--body` / `--body-file`, and missing members abort before qitem creation. v0.3.2 slice-21 FR-4 adds `--body-file <path>` (use `-` for stdin) which kills the backtick-shell-corruption class for multiline bodies, and first-class `--mission <id>` / `--slice <id>` flags that translate to `mission:<id>` / `slice:<id>` tags (compose with `--tags`). v0.4.6 (OPR.0.4.6.MH3) adds `--host <id>` / the `agent@rig@host` destination form — see § Cross-host queue routing below.
- `claim <qitemId> --destination <session> [--json]` — pending → in-progress; computes closure_required_at from tier
- `unclaim <qitemId> --destination <session> [--reason <text>] [--json]` — in-progress → pending
- `update <qitemId> --actor <session> --state <state> [--closure-reason <r>] [--closure-target <t>] [--note <text>] [--json]`
- `handoff <qitemId> --from <session> --to <session> [--body <text> | --body-file <path>] [--note <text>] [--priority <p>] [--tier <t>] [--tags <csv>] [--host <id>] [--json]` — transactional close-as-handed-off + create-new; v0.4.6 (OPR.0.4.6.MH3) adds `--host <id>` / the `agent@rig@host` `--to` form (§ Cross-host queue routing)
- `handoff-and-complete <qitemId> --from <session> --to <session> [--body <text> | --body-file <path>] [--note <text>] [--priority <p>] [--tier <t>] [--tags <csv>] [--host <id>] [--json]` — variant of `handoff` that closes the source as `done` (terminal) instead of `handed-off`; same atomic close+create, chain_of_record, default-nudge, and cross-host contracts
- `fallback <qitemId> --destination <session> [--reason <text>] [--json]` — reroute to fallback seat
- `show <qitemId> [--json]`
- `transitions <qitemId> [--json]` — append-only transition log
- `list [--destination <session>] [--source <session>] [--owned] [--mine] [--state <csv>] [-a | --all] [-A | --all-rigs] [--full] [-o <json|wide>] [--limit <n>] [--json]` — **v0.4.0 grammar (slices 28 + 32, docker / kubectl-aligned)**:
  - **`rig queue list`** (no flags) → active states only (`pending` / `in-progress` / `claimed` / `blocked` / `handed-off`; NOT `done` / `canceled`), **current-rig** breadth, compact rows: `qitemId`, `state`, `source→destination` (or `current-owner`), `closure_reason` / `closure_target` (when handed-off / blocked), `mission`, `slice`, `tier` / `priority`, `age` / `updated_at`, short title, capped tags. Excludes: full body, chain_of_record, transition history, proof / artifact blobs.
  - **`-a` / `--all`** → include closed / done history within the current breadth (docker `-a` axis: history).
  - **`-A` / `--all-rigs`** → cross-rig breadth (kubectl `-A` axis: breadth). Composable with `-a`, `--owned`, `--mine`, `--full`.
  - **`--full`** → add body + chain-of-record + full tags + transition history to whichever scope is selected (field-breadth axis).
  - **`-o json|wide`** → encoding, compact-by-default. `-o json` does NOT imply full body (compact JSON is token-safe + machine-parseable); `--full -o json` returns the full JSON.
  - **`--owned`** → obligations assigned to the caller (`destination_session` only).
  - **`--mine`** → the caller's source-or-destination union, including rows the caller authored but does not own.
  - Pipeline use must enable `set -o pipefail`; otherwise the shell reports only the downstream formatter's status and can mask a nonzero `rig` read such as a timeout.
  - `--destination <s>` / `--source <s>` / `--state <csv>` keep working and compose with the new flags.
  - The four axes (scope × history × field-breadth × encoding) are orthogonal and composable. The bare unscoped firehose that aggregated cross-rig + full-history (~64,000 tokens on the live host) is retired as a default — opt-in via `-A -a --full`.
  - Use `rig queue show <qitemId>` for the body preview; `rig queue show <qitemId> --full --json` returns the original complete record. Preview JSON adds `readView` with completeness, omitted content, full JSON byte size and the exact expansion command.
- `overdue [--json]` — in-progress qitems past closure_required_at
- `inbox-drop <destinationSession> --sender <session> (--body <text> | --body-file <path>) [--tags <csv>] [--urgency <u>] [--audit <pointer>] [--id <inboxId>] [--json]`
- `inbox-absorb <inboxId> --receiver <session> [--json]` — promote a pending inbox entry to a queue_item
- `inbox-deny <inboxId> --receiver <session> --reason <text> [--json]`
- `inbox-pending <destinationSession> [--json]`
- `outbox-record --sender <session> --destination <session> (--body <text> | --body-file <path>) [--tags <csv>] [--urgency <u>] [--audit <pointer>] [--id <outboxId>] [--json]`
- `outbox-list <senderSession> [--limit <n>] [--json]`

Hot-potato strict-rejection (load-bearing API contract):
- `update --state done` REQUIRES `--closure-reason` from one of: `handed_off_to`, `blocked_on`, `denied`, `canceled`, `no-follow-on`, `escalation`. Missing or invalid reason → exit 1 with structured error naming the 6 valid values.
- `closure-reason` of `handed_off_to`, `blocked_on`, or `escalation` additionally requires `--closure-target`.
- All hot-potato enforcement happens at the daemon domain layer; every surface (CLI, future MCP, future UI) inherits the same guarantee.

Closure-reason semantics:
- `handed_off_to` — work continues at a different seat (target = new owner). `handoff` subcommand is the preferred path; `update` accepts it for non-handoff terminal closures.
- `blocked_on` — parked pending another qitem (target = blocker qitem_id).
- `denied` — receiver rejected the work.
- `canceled` — sender or receiver withdrew.
- `no-follow-on` — terminal completion, nothing else needed.
- `escalation` — kicked up to a higher tier (target = escalation target).

### Cross-host queue routing (v0.4.6 — OPR.0.4.6.MH3)

`rig queue create`, `handoff`, and `handoff-and-complete` can target a destination on ANOTHER
registered host: `--host <id>` or the host-qualified destination form `member@rig@<host>` (both
resolve to the same out-of-band `hostId` request envelope; naming both with DIFFERENT hosts is a
structured ambiguity error). The mechanism generalizes the shipped mission-control
forward-then-strip WRITE: the local daemon resolves the host registry server-side (bearers never
reach the caller), strips the host at the edge, and forwards the WHOLE body over HTTP to the
target daemon — see `docs/as-built/architecture/coordination-primitive.md` § Cross-host queue
routing for the full model. Load-bearing contract points:

- **Explicit-only (no selection follow).** Queue verbs route cross-host ONLY on `--host` / the
  3-part form — they NEVER consult the persisted `rig host select` selection (a durable write and
  a hot-potato close must not silently re-home on yesterday's sticky selection). This is a
  deliberate asymmetry with the observe/interactive verbs, which do follow selection.
- **Origin-owns-the-record.** The qitem lives in the TARGET host's DB; that row is THE record.
  No local ghost row is ever written, and the target daemon's OWN nudge fires on ITS local tmux
  (the whole body — including the `nudge` flag — is forwarded).
- **At-least-once + idempotent, never exactly-once.** The forwarding daemon MINTS the qitem id
  before the first forward (a retry carries the same id by construction); a cross-host handoff's
  successor id is DERIVED deterministically from (source qitem, destination, host) — namespaced
  `qitem-xh-…`, so a re-driven forward absorbs on the target's primary key. Retrying is safe;
  a same-id create whose identity fields differ is a structured `qitem_id_reuse` error.
- **Never-drop ordering.** A cross-host handoff creates the successor on the target host FIRST
  and closes the local source SECOND. A crash between the two leaves a live duplicate that the
  idempotent re-drive converges — never a source closed toward a successor that doesn't exist.
  Re-drives: an already-closed source with the MATCHING `closure_target` absorbs as success; a
  MISMATCH is a structured `cross_host_close_conflict` (409) — surfaced, never overwritten.
  *(Named residual, inherent to at-least-once/no-2PC: a re-drive naming a DIFFERENT destination
  is a NEW handoff decision and can leave the earlier successor live on the target host — visible
  via the chain + provenance tags, not a dedup bug.)*
- **Closure fields.** The cross-host source close records `closure_reason=handed_off_to` and
  `closure_target=member@rig@<host>` — `closure_target` is OPAQUE audit/display metadata,
  presence-checked and NEVER parsed for routing (any PR parsing it as a session string is a spec
  violation). Session-string carriers (`destination_session`, `source_session`, `blocked_on`,
  `handed_off_to`) stay 2-part `member@rig` (BR-1). The forwarded successor carries the continued
  `chain_of_record`; those A-side ids are OPAQUE lineage identifiers on the target host (they do
  not dereference in the target's DB). Provenance: the forwarded item is tagged `cross-host` +
  `from-host:<sender's self-declared name>` (honest best-effort, not authenticated identity).
- **Failure honesty.** Unknown host / ssh-declared host / unreachable / auth-failed each surface
  as a distinct structured `remote_queue_write_failed` error naming the host — nothing is written
  on either side. Transport is http-ONLY (the daemon→daemon path is what fires the remote nudge;
  the `rig send --host` ssh shell-out is a different mechanism, untouched).
- **Local zero-regression.** No `--host` (or `local`) = today's local path, byte-identical.
  Claim / update / inbox verbs stay local-by-principle: after a cross-host handoff the successor
  lives on the target host where its worker lives. Sender-side operations on an already-forwarded
  item (cancel/update from the sending host) are a named follow-up, out of v1.

## Coordination Project / Classifier and View (PL-004 Phase B)

Two top-level commands extend the coordination layer with L2 (project / classifier) and L5 (views).

### `rig project`

Usage: `rig project <subcommand>` — L2 agent-backed classifier with daemon-enforced lease + idempotency + reclaim.

Subcommands:
- `lease-acquire [options]` — acquire the active classifier lease for the caller.
- `lease-heartbeat [options]` — send a heartbeat for an active classifier lease (extends TTL). A lease already past its TTL refuses with `lease_expired`; acquire again instead.
- `lease-show [options]` — show the currently-active classifier lease.
- `reclaim-classifier [options]` — operator verb to reclaim the active classifier lease. Use `--if-dead` to refuse if holder is still alive.
- `classify <streamItemId> [options]` — project a stream item with classification fields. Idempotent on `stream_item_id` (first write wins). Requires `--lease-id`: the result is refused (`lease_mismatch`, `lease_expired`, `lease_held`) unless that exact lease is active, unexpired and held by `--session` at write time. Optional `--area`, `--scope-ref` (with `--candidate-set-version`), `--duplicate-of`, `--needs-human true|false` (omit when unknown), `--classifier-version`, `--taxonomy-version`, `--attempt-id` with `--execution-id`. Without `--attempt-id` the result is a manual classification, not bound to the attempt ledger. Every supplied field must be a string (IDs and versions non-empty); `--needs-human` omitted means unknown.
- `list [options]` — list project classifications with filters (`--session`, `--destination`, `--area`, `--scope-ref`, `--needs-human true|false|unknown`).
- `show <projectId> [options]` — show one project classification.

Notes:
- Lease semantics: only one classifier holds the active lease at a time. Heartbeats extend TTL only while the lease is unexpired. Re-acquiring your own expired lease issues a new lease id, so results bound to the old id are refused; another session must use `--evaluate-deadness-first` or the reclaim verb.
- Attempt ledger (daemon HTTP, used by a classifier occupant): `POST /api/projects/attempts/begin`, `/attempts/:id/abstain`, `/attempts/:id/fail`, `GET /api/projects/eligible`. Abstentions and errors are recorded there, never in the classification row; errors retry with bounded backoff, then end `exhausted`. Every `begin` (including a timeout or error retry) returns a new `executionId`; only the current one can abstain, fail or bind a result (`attempt_superseded` otherwise), because a renewable lease never proves an older execution stopped.
- `classify` enforces L1→L2 foreign-key existence: the referenced `stream_items` row must exist or the call is rejected before any state mutation.
- `reclaim-classifier` is the operator-side verb to recover from a hung classifier; `--if-dead` adds a liveness guard so a still-heartbeating classifier is not stolen from.

### `rig view`

Usage: `rig view <subcommand>` — L5 daemon-backed views over coordination state.

Subcommands:
- `list [options]` — list built-in + custom views.
- `show <viewName> [options]` — run a view (built-in or custom).
- `register [options]` — register or update a custom view.

Built-in views:
- `recently-active`, `founder`, `pod-load`, `escalations`, `held`, `activity`.

Notes:
- Views emit a `view.changed` SSE event on every state mutation that affects them. Queue update mutations bridge to `queue.updated` and then to `view.changed` for all six built-in views (Phase B R2).
- Custom view registration writes to the `views_custom` table; the daemon hot-reloads on registration.

## Coordination Watchdog (PL-004 Phase C)

`rig watchdog` registers, lists, inspects, and stops daemon-native scheduler jobs. The scheduler runs inside the daemon supervision tree and persists state in SQLite (`watchdog_jobs`/`watchdog_history`); jobs survive daemon restarts. Three policies are available at v1: `periodic-reminder`, `artifact-pool-ready`, and `edge-artifact-required`. The fourth POC policy `workflow-keepalive` is rejected with `policy_deferred_to_phase_d` and ships in Phase D.

### `rig watchdog`

- `register --spec <path> --policy <name> --target-session <s> --interval-seconds <n> --registered-by <s>` — register a job from a YAML spec; `--active-wake-interval-seconds` and `--scan-interval-seconds` are pool-ready-specific opt-ins.
- `list` — list all jobs (active + stopped + terminal).
- `show <job_id>` — show one job.
- `status <job_id>` — show job + recent evaluation history (last 20 entries).
- `stop <job_id> [--reason <text>]` — operator stop; scheduler skips the job thereafter.

History records only loud evaluations: `sent` (delivery executed) or `terminal` (policy declared the job done). Quiet skip reasons (`not_due`, `no_actionable_artifacts`, `no_missing_edge_artifacts`, `active_wake_not_due`) are NOT recorded — POC parity so agents are not woken about scheduler polls. Loud `skipped` rows are recorded only if a policy returns a non-quiet reason.

Phase D extends the policy enum with `workflow-keepalive` (the policy deferred from Phase C). It reads `workflow_instances` directly via SQLite, requires `status: active|waiting`, and resolves frontier qitem owners from `queue_items`.

## Workflow Runtime (PL-004 Phase D)

`rig workflow` operates on the daemon-native Workflow Runtime: declarative spec validation, instance creation, step projection (transactional-scribe), trace, and idempotent continue. Workflow specs are markdown/YAML files on disk (workspace-surface); the daemon caches them in SQLite for fast lookup.

### `rig workflow`

- `validate <specPath>` — validate a workflow spec file; returns structured ok/error report (role resolution, step uniqueness, allowed-exits consistency, optional seat liveness). Spec-only: it takes no rig context (OPR.0.4.6.FAC1 arch ruling — rig-coverage checks happen at instantiate).
- `compile <missionPath> [--operation-key <key>]` — read `project.yaml` →
  `mission.yaml` → `slice.yaml` into an inspectable lifecycle graph without
  creating a cached spec, workflow instance, or qitem.
- `instantiate-lifecycle <missionPath> --operation-key <key> --root-objective
  <text> --created-by <session>` — compile and start an eligible lifecycle;
  `--entry-owner` and `--rig` retain their normal workflow meanings. The opaque
  operation key makes exact replay idempotent and conflicting reuse refuses.
- `instantiate <specPath> --root-objective <text> --created-by <session>` — create a new instance + entry-step qitem in the same daemon transaction; `--entry-owner <session>` overrides the default entry owner. **OPR.0.4.6.FAC1**: `--rig <name>` binds the instance to a rig (overrides the spec's `target.rig` DEFAULT; persists as `boundRig` on the instance, rendered by `show`/`trace` and carried in `--json`). On a bound instance, a role with **no `preferred_targets`** resolves to a live capable SEAT on that rig by the pure capability policy (running agents declaring the role, managed seats only, required runtime, least pending backlog, deterministic coordinate tiebreak). Unknown rig = structured `bound_rig_unknown`; a bound-rig role no seat structurally declares = `bound_rig_role_uncovered` (existence at any lifecycle state satisfies it — liveness is checked when the step projects). No `--rig` and no spec default = unbound, byte-identical pre-FAC-1 behavior.
- `run <specPath> …` — accepts the same `--rig <name>` binding (run instantiates too).
- `project --instance <id> --current-packet <qitem-id> --exit <handoff|waiting|done|failed> --actor-session <session>` — close the current packet AND project the next-step packet IN THE SAME daemon transaction (transactional-scribe; lost handoffs impossible by design). `--result-note <text>`, `--blocked-on <ref>`, `--next-owner <session>` modify behavior.
- `list [--status <s>]` — list instances; optionally filter by status (`active`/`waiting`/`completed`/`failed`).
- `show <instanceId>` — show one instance.
- `revise <instanceId>` — inspect authored versus bound lifecycle input without
  writing. The result names changed sources/steps, composition, compatibility,
  and an apply command containing the inspected version, digest and operation
  key. Fill in the actor and decision before using `--apply`.
- `operation <key>` — recover the original lifecycle creation or revision
  receipt and current instance after a lost response or later source edit.
- `trace <instanceId>` — show the instance + its append-only step trail (audit-only).
- `continue <instanceId>` — idempotent inspector; in v1 returns the current state.

The owner-as-author + workflow-as-transactional-scribe contract is enforced by the daemon. The owner of a packet decides when it closes; the workflow runtime atomically records the closure AND creates/projects the next qitem per the workflow spec, in a single daemon transaction.

### Project-owned release profiles

`project.lifecycle.profile` selects a key in `project.lifecycle.profiles`. Each
selected entry contains `required_steps` (a nonempty list of stable obligation
IDs) and `workflow` (the ordinary workflow language). The reusable example at
[`project-release-profile.yaml`](../reference/project-release-profile.yaml)
names nine release-ceremony stages followed by one `release-boundary` judgment.
That final judgment covers the seven areas of the canonical
[`release-boundary.md`](../reference/release-boundary.md) checklist in one
agent-authored record. It does not create seven automatic gates.

Put the profile in `project.yaml` once; release missions need only their ordinary
composition. Customize the example's project ID, roles, and policy for the
project. Every profile step declares `depends_on` (including `[]` on roots);
conditional `next_hop.on` jumps are refused so required stages cannot be bypassed.
Missing required IDs refuse with `lifecycle_required_step_missing`.
Prerequisite cycles make compilation ineligible with `dependency_cycle`, even
when `loop_guards.max_hops` is set. That guard bounds routing loops; it cannot
make mutually dependent steps ready.

Precedence is explicit:

- With a selected project graph and no mission workflow, the mission inherits it.
- `mission.lifecycle: {profile: <same-profile>, mode: extend, workflow: ...}` adds
  new steps, merges roles by name, and appends context references. An extension
  cannot replace a step ID; its workflow accepts only `steps`, `roles`, and
  `context_refs`.
- `mode: override` supplies a replacement workflow. All required project step IDs
  and the prerequisite relationships between them must remain. Additional
  intermediate stages are allowed. An omitted or unknown mode with competing
  workflows refuses with `lifecycle_override_ambiguous`.
- Without `project.lifecycle.profiles`, the existing mission-authored workflow
  takes precedence over slice execution declarations. This legacy path remains
  supported and reports an advisory that no project graph is selected. Adding a
  project graph to an existing copied mission workflow requires explicit mode
  selection or removal of the copy. Project lifecycle fields such as an inert
  `workflow` or `workflow_ref` are refused rather than silently ignored.

An authored, ready successor may be a mission extension step depending on
`release-boundary`. Without that extension, `release-boundary` exits `done` and
finishes the current lifecycle. The runtime creates the continuation packet;
the agent judges readiness and performs any authorized activation. It does not
infer readiness from a folder or activate future scope automatically.

Compilation exposes `graphSource` (selection mode, project/mission addresses,
required IDs), the complete `workflowSpec`, dependencies, and source digests.
These are bound into the compiled input digest and persisted at instantiation.
Changing source bytes under an existing operation key refuses. Relative paths
passed to both CLI `compile` and `instantiate-lifecycle` are resolved against the
**caller cwd before HTTP**, so daemon cwd cannot change their meaning.

`workflow guidance <instance> [--packet <qitem>] [--component <id>] [--full]`
reads current selected SDLC teaching and original SPEC intent. `workflow show`
and `workflow continue` expose the same guidance. Entry, handoff, route and resume
packets carry a compact preview; existing admitted wait notices refresh it at
send time. Healthy waiting does not read or inject the catalog on every tick.

Selection follows project → mission → explicit active slice (or a legacy slice's
exact executable identity). A narrower component list replaces ancestor components
and edges; an omitted catalog inherits. Bound member lists alone do not select an
active slice. Catalog addresses use the shared H2/H3 resolver: absolute or
`$OPENRIG_HOME` paths, paths relative to the declaring manifest, `root: repository`
from that manifest's Git tree, or a file declared by the installed context library.
Missing/ambiguous components and unavailable sources are named unknowns; prose
stays verbatim and has no required semantic field ontology.

Compact guidance previews one component, using exact owner matches where possible;
otherwise it labels a menu preview. Position remains unknown: neither array order,
clock nor handoff infers method progress. `--full` expands components relevant to
current packet custody (all selected components when none match); `--component`
chooses one explicitly. Whole oversized prose blocks are omitted with an expansion
notice, so a clipped caveat never masquerades as complete teaching.

Guidance reports manifest hashes against the lifecycle binding and the current
catalog hash. Referenced prose is current authored advice, not a cached executable
snapshot. YAML selection edits use the existing revision path; catalog-only prose
changes refresh on read without creating work or a new revision store. Reading
advice, receiving a notice and independent acceptance remain distinct.

`workflow show`, read-only `workflow revise`, and the TUI distinguish current,
source-only, compatible, incompatible and unavailable authored comparisons.
Catalog or membership bytes can change without changing executable steps;
file edits do not silently adopt either kind of change. A supported `revise
--apply` preserves completed/live steps, required obligations, queue custody and
prior receipts while adopting future-step changes on the same instance. It
requires the inspected version/digest, a stable operation key, actor and reason.
Changed completed/live steps, removed obligations and unsupported migrations
refuse with a specific explanation; restore the protected contract and revise
unstarted successors. After an ambiguous response, inspect `workflow operation
<key>` or retry the identical apply command to recover its one committed effect.

Mission-bound continuation and wait guidance carries a snapshot of authored
planning, wave admission/review and integration rules, with a pointer to inspect
the current source before deciding. Waves guide agents; executable dependencies
schedule steps. Bound slice sources do not automatically create child workflows.
The execution view also reads current arrangement guidance into `planning_guidance`
with exact source fields. Ordinary mission/wave/slice inspection keeps admission,
review and accepted-core/full-contract guidance distinct from executable edges,
attributed proof and current custody; prose does not create those facts.

`workflow show`/JSON and the TUI execution view show every named obligation with
its state and receipt state. Required steps need `project --evidence-ref <ref>`
on a successful `done`/`handoff` exit; missing references refuse before mutation
with `lifecycle_receipt_required`. Waiting and failed exits remain available.
The projection records who supplied the reference and when. `recorded` means an
attributed workflow receipt exists, not that the daemon verified its substance.
An ordinary terminal queue row never supplies that receipt. Agents inspect the
actual evidence, including reasoned not-applicable or deferred boundary areas.
Existing typed `acceptance` contracts remain separate and retain their checks.

### Authored mission boundary (legacy)

Without a project-owned graph, when a mission declares `lifecycle.workflow`, `compile` uses that explicit
workflow instead of deriving steps from active slices. Slice membership and
backlinks are still validated and included in provenance; slice SDLC selections
do not add workflow steps or gates. `lifecycle.profile` must match the profile
selected in `project.yaml`:

```yaml
# Add to mission.yaml; project.yaml already selects release-boundary-v0.
lifecycle:
  profile: release-boundary-v0
  workflow:
    context_refs: [SPEC.md, PROGRESS.md, NOTES.md]
    entry: {role: orchestrator}
    roles:
      orchestrator: {preferred_targets: [orch@my-rig]}
    steps:
      - id: mission-boundary
        actor_role: orchestrator
        objective: Inspect current evidence and decide the next authored exit.
        allowed_exits: [waiting, done, failed]
        re_present_after_seconds: 300
        re_present_max_seconds: 3600
```

The nested `workflow` uses the ordinary workflow language; its ID defaults to
`lifecycle-<project>-<mission>`, and its compiled version is derived from source
digests. Boundary steps explicitly allowing `waiting` default to a five-minute
initial reminder and a one-hour cap; both fields in the example override those
defaults. Missing operation identity leaves compilation ineligible. Instantiation
with one opaque `--operation-key` persists the compiled input digest and lifecycle
binding; exact replay returns the same instance/entry packet, and changed input
under that key refuses. Authoring alone never starts an instance.

`context_refs` carries addresses in entry, successor, route/resume, and reminder
packets. The lifecycle compiler also includes the project/mission manifests and
`project.install.context`. Relative project references resolve from the project
root; profile workflow references resolve from the project root and mission workflow
references from the mission directory. References
are not evidence verdicts: the receiving agent opens current context, may inspect
beyond it, and chooses the exit. The daemon neither interprets receipts nor
activates a mission. `rigx project` remains a separate manual shadow.

Outside mission-boundary compilation, an unmapped `waiting` exit with
`re_present_after_seconds` alone remains one-shot.
Adding `re_present_max_seconds` opts into an existing queue/watchdog timer that
repeats with exponential backoff: the example waits 5, 10, 20, 40, then 60 minutes
between reminders. The cap must be an integer at least as large as the initial
delay. No new packet is created. Repeated waiting acknowledgments retain the
schedule; changed structured `closureEvidence` or a new blocker resets it.
`rig workflow project --evidence-ref <ref>` records an attributed reference as
closure evidence, without interpreting it or substituting for typed acceptance. Omitted
evidence preserves the prior evidence, and object key order is immaterial.

A transition on the exact qitem blocker makes the reminder due on the next
scheduler tick (normally within one second), resetting the initial delay.
Wake delivery receipts do not count as progress. The workflow's own waiting
acknowledgments are on its frontier packet, not its upstream blocker; a repeating
wait cannot name itself as its blocker. Blocker completion retains native
queue unpark/wake behavior. Terminal or rerouted packets retire their timer.
Restart reconciles blocker transition identity and resumes the persisted delay;
replaying the same transition does not create another wake. A live repeating
timer can have an unconsumed wake: these are separate facts in park status.
Hard human gates are authored using the existing `gate` field; a reminder does
not manufacture a gate or satisfy one.

## Operational Inspection

Read-only inspection commands for compaction planning, workflow heartbeat, and seat handover observability. Default mode is read-only across this section.

### `rig compact-plan`

Usage: `rig compact-plan [--rig <name>] [--refresh] [--threshold-tokens <n>] [--threshold-percent <0-100>] [--json]`

Notes:
- Plans Claude compact-in-place candidates without compacting anything (read-only triage).
- `--threshold-tokens <n>` is the estimated used-token threshold; `--threshold-percent <0-100>` is the used-percent threshold when the context window size is missing.
- Output identifies seats that are candidates for compaction by current heuristics; the operator decides what (if anything) to compact.

### `rig heartbeat`

Usage: `rig heartbeat [--rig <name>] [--nudge] [--include-done] [--json]`

Notes:
- Shows workflow execution proof state from queue files.
- Default mode is read-only. `--nudge` sends informational proof instructions to stalled or unproven owners; it does not modify queue files or reroute work.
- `--include-done` includes done/handed-off queue items in the output (excluded by default).

### `rig seat`

Usage: `rig seat <subcommand>`

Subcommands:
- `status <seat> [options]` — show read-only seat handover observability status.
- `handover <seat> [options]` — plan a safe two-phase seat handover.
- `launch <seat> --fresh --reason <text> [--stop] [--operator <address>] [--json]`
  — create a deliberate blank occupant for exactly one existing seat. No
  continuity source is used; a live managed occupant requires `--stop`, while
  adopted or unmanaged ambiguity refuses.
- `clear-attention <session> [--reason <text>] [--json]` — evidence-gated, operator-attested, audited reconcile of a stuck `attention_required` seat.

Notes:
- `status` reads the seat-handover observability tables (migration `021`); it does not mutate anything.
- `handover` plans the two-phase sequence; actual execution happens through the existing seat-launch surfaces under operator gating.
- `clear-attention` (v0.3.4) clears a stuck `attention_required` startup status using captured evidence; `--reason <text>` is an operator attestation override that skips the evidence gate (audited). Replaces SQLite hand-edit workarounds.

## Mission Control / Queue Observability (PL-005 Phase A)

Mission Control is an integrated product UI inside the existing shell, NOT a new `rig` command. PL-005 originally named the read-only node surface as `rig ps --nodes --json`; under the v0.4.4 disclosure ladder, the fleet-wide projected node source is `rig ps --nodes -A --json`.

Mission Control is reached via the product UI at the `/mission-control` route. The HTTP API surface (`/api/mission-control/*`) is documented in `docs/as-built/architecture/mission-control.md`. The 7 verbs (`approve`, `deny`, `route`, `annotate`, `hold`, `drop`, `handoff`) execute via `POST /api/mission-control/action`; the 7 views are read via `GET /api/mission-control/views/:view-name`.

Mission Control consumes `rig ps --nodes -A --json` for fleet roll-up where the canonical CLI source is preferred. Cross-CLI-version drift is handled per the 4 sub-clauses of PRD § Runtime/Source Drift Acceptance: missing fields surface as honest "field unavailable on this rig's daemon version" placeholders; once-per-session-per-rig logging avoids spam; the fleet view shows a top-level "rigs running stale CLI" indicator.

## Agent Images, Context Packs, and Workspace (v0.3.0)

Three top-level commands shipped in v0.3.0 for operator-authored library content (agent images and context packs) and the workspace primitive.

### `rig agent-image`

Usage: `rig agent-image <subcommand>` — browse, snapshot, and manage agent images (PL-016).

Subcommands:
- `list [options]` — list all agent images in the library.
- `show <name-or-id> [options]` — show image manifest + statistics.
- `preview <name-or-id> [options]` — show manifest + sized supplementary file metadata + starter snippet.
- `create <source-session> [options]` — capture a productive seat's resumable state into a new agent image.
- `delete <name-or-id> [options]` — delete an agent image (subject to evidence-preservation guard).
- `pin <name-or-id> [options]` — pin an image so prune cannot delete it.
- `unpin <name-or-id> [options]` — unpin an image.
- `prune [options]` — delete evictable images (protected by evidence-preservation guard).
- `sync [options]` — re-walk discovery roots and refresh the library index.

Notes:
- Images are an operator-authored library form; deletion is gated by an evidence-preservation guard so productive seat snapshots are not lost accidentally.
- `pin` / `unpin` are the operator levers for explicit retention; `prune` honours them.

### `rig context`

Usage: `rig context <subcommand>` — browse, preview, compose, and manage operator-authored context packs. This noun never delivers; delivery belongs to `send`, `broadcast`, `walk`, and `queue create`.

Subcommands:
- `work-install [--project <id>] [--mission <id>] [--slice <id>] [--deliver] [--runtime <claude-code|claude|codex>] [--cwd <agent-working-directory>] [--topology <ids>] [--apply-skills] [--json]` — resolve project/mission/slice Markdown plus `project.yaml install.skills` in one plan. With `--runtime`, composes system, topology, and project selectors and reports per-skill provenance/status; `--apply-skills` safely reconciles the owned harness projection into `--cwd` (default: the caller's current working directory), not the workspace metadata directory. Omitting `--runtime` skips skill inspection regardless of `OPENRIG_RUNTIME`; applying skills requires an explicit runtime.
- `profile <name-or-ref> --situation <fresh|handover|post-compaction> [--runtime <claude-code|claude|codex>] [--profile <id>] [--budget <tokens>] [--rig <rig> --seat <seat>] [--mission <mission>] [--slice <slice>] [--json]` — compose the selected atom graph and explicitly granted context. Runtime defaults to `OPENRIG_RUNTIME`, otherwise Claude; an unknown nonempty environment value warns and falls back to Claude. An explicit flag overrides the environment.
- `list [options]` — list all context packs in the library.
- `show <name-or-ref> [options]` — show pack manifest + per-file metadata.
- `preview <name-or-ref> [options]` — show the assembled bundle without delivering it.
- `compose --out <ref> --from <files...>` — compose ordered files into a durable context ref without delivering it.
- `sync [options]` — re-walk discovery roots and refresh the library index.
- `add <source> [--git] [--checkout] [--pack <relative-path>] [--name <ref>] [--json]` — install a directory/manifest URL, or clone a Git repository with `--git`. Git discovery checks the repository-root manifest and `.openrig/context-packs`; multiple packs require an explicit `--pack`. `--checkout` selects an existing local checkout whose branch may be merged by an update.
- `source inspect <ref> [--json]` — distinguish the selected revision/digest, current served edits, checkout branch/revision/status/conflicts, and locally known upstream divergence. It does not fetch or prove consumption.
- `source update <ref> [--json]` — explicitly fetch and merge the selected checkout branch’s upstream, then publish its clean declared pack inputs. Dirty checkouts or edited served selections stop before update. Conflicts/unavailable upstream retain the old served selection and both Git sides.
- `rm <ref> [options]` — remove a context pack by its path-like ref.

Notes:
- Context packs are operator-authored bundles of context (manifest + files) intended to prime a managed seat with a coherent starting context.
- Both `profile` and `work-install` accept `claude-code`, its alias `claude`, and `codex`. Invalid explicit values fail during CLI argument parsing, before context lookup or projection. JSON metadata retains the consumer's existing keys: `profile.runtime` is `claude` or `codex`; `skillProjection.runtime` is `claude-code` or `codex`. Both Claude spellings produce the same selection and metadata within each command; manifest runtime keys remain unchanged.
- For example, `rig context profile world-public --situation fresh --runtime claude-code` and `rig context work-install --runtime claude-code` use the same runtime spelling. Profile atoms that read seat context still require both `--rig` and `--seat`.
- `preview` is the canonical read-only way to inspect the assembled content.
- This command family is delivery-free; context-window inspection is not part of this noun.

Git source example (use the intended instance and existing Git credentials):

```bash
rig context add <repository-path-or-URL> --git --name team-world
rig context source inspect team-world --json
# Edit/commit in the reported checkout with ordinary Git.
rig context source update team-world --json
rig context get team-world
```

Git selections copy only `manifest.yaml` and its declared files into the existing
context library; `.openrig-git-source.json` records the retained checkout, pack,
revision, selection time and digest. The checkout and previous selections live
beside the configured library under `<context.root>-git-checkouts` and
`<context.root>-git-history`. They are retained when a selected pack is removed.
Local-only inspection compares against cached upstream refs; only explicit update
contacts the remote. Git uses existing credentials, with terminal prompting disabled
and a 60-second command timeout; a failure retains the checkout for native Git diagnosis.

Commit local improvements in the checkout before updating. If someone edited the
served copy directly, preserve those edits in the checkout and commit them; restore
the served copy to its recorded selection explicitly before retrying. No automatic
stash, reset, rebase, push or conflict strategy runs. A merge conflict remains in the
checkout for an owning author to resolve/commit or abort with Git. Only then retry
update. Selected bytes, successful `context get`, and a consumer demonstrably using
them are separate facts. This command does not automatically adopt context in other
instances or prove that an agent consumed it.

### `rig workspace`

Usage: `rig workspace <subcommand>` — Workspace Primitive (PL-007), v0 typed-kind tooling.

Subcommands:
- `validate [root] [--kind <kind>] [--no-recursive] [--require-frontmatter] [--max-files <n>] [--json]` — walk a workspace root, parse each `.md` file's YAML frontmatter, and emit a structured gap report. Advisory only — never modifies files. Default root: `cwd`. `--kind` validates against a specific workspace kind (`user | project | knowledge | lab | delivery`). `--max-files` (default `10000`) hard-caps the walk; v0.3.2 slice-01 GA enforces strict-int regex on this flag.
- `doctor [--workspace <path>] [--strict] [--json]` — run an 8-check workspace-readiness diagnostic against the daemon's resolved workspace (workspace root, missions folder, file allowlist, daemon alignment, daemon reload, optional slice docs, current `NOTES.md` or readable legacy notes, and SDLC convention sections). Read-only. Default exit-code: non-zero only on `fail`; `--strict` makes warn-or-fail non-zero.

Notes:
- v0 surface was intentionally narrow (`validate` only); v0.3.2 added `doctor` as the operator-facing readiness diagnostic.
- Future versions will add typed-kind authoring/refactor tooling on the same root walker.
- See `rig config init-workspace` to scaffold a fresh default workspace.

## Plugin Inspection (v0.3.1)

One read-only top-level command added in v0.3.1 to inspect plugins
discovered from `$OPENRIG_HOME/plugins/` (default `~/.openrig/plugins/`).
No `install` verb at v0 — installation is explicit operator copy or
symlink per each plugin's `OPENRIG-INSTALL.md`.

### `rig plugin`

Usage: `rig plugin <subcommand>` — read-only plugin inspection.

Subcommands:
- `list [options]` — list discoverable plugins (aggregated across vendored + runtime caches).
- `show <id> [options]` — show plugin manifest + skills + hooks + mcp servers.
- `used-by <id> [options]` — list agents referencing this plugin in their `profile.uses.plugins[]`.
- `validate <path> [options]` — validate plugin manifest + skill frontmatter against the agentskills.io spec.

Notes:
- `used-by` includes bare `<id>` and `shared:<id>` profile references from user and shipped agents, even if the plugin is not installed. Resource definitions without a consuming profile are listed separately; JSON rows distinguish `kind: consumer` from `kind: definition`.
- Plugin discovery aggregates `$OPENRIG_HOME/plugins/` (vendored at runtime by the operator) with the daemon's bundled plugin cache.
- `openrig-core` ships bundled with the daemon (11 skills). Additional plugins (`gstack` — 45 skills; `obra-superpowers` — 14 skills) ship as substrate references for plugin authors to copy-install per the `OPENRIG-INSTALL.md` workflow inside each plugin's source tree.
- A first-class `rig plugin install <substrate-path>` verb is deferred to 0.3.2.

## Scope Tree Primitive (v0.3.2)

One top-level command first shipped in v0.3.2 (`scopeCommand`,
`packages/cli/src/index.ts:20,187`; defined in
`packages/cli/src/commands/scope.ts`; release-0.3.2 slice 12). Operates
the scope tree (missions, slices, sub-slices) per
`conventions/scope-and-versioning`.

### `rig scope`

Usage: `rig scope <subcommand>` — scope tree primitive: missions, slices, sub-slices.

Top-level option:
- `--workspace <path>` — override workspace root (otherwise use the typed `workspace.slices_root` setting; `$OPENRIG_WORK_ROOT` remains a legacy override).

Two subcommand groups: `slice` and `mission`.

`rig scope slice <subcommand>` — slice-tier commands:
- `ls [--mission <name>] [--state <state>] [--json]` — list slices in a mission (or across all missions). `--state` filter: `active | closed | shipped | all` (default `active`).
- `show <slice-path> [--mission <name>] [--json]` — inspect a single slice (frontmatter + README + children). `slice-path` is absolute, relative-to-substrate, or `NN-slug`; `--mission` hints the mission when path is just `NN-slug`.
- `create <mission> <slug> [--template <kind>] [--title <text>] [--intent <text>] [--depends-on <dot-id...>] [--json]` — create a mode-neutral slice scaffold: one intent-bearing `SPEC.md` with the three convention sections, `PROGRESS.md`, `PROOF.md`, and `proof/`. `depends_on` accepts same-mission sibling slice dot-IDs and is advisory build-order data. Every template kind emits the same file set; mode richness composes through the template seam.
- `progress <slice-path> [--mission <name>] [--status <state>] [--milestone <text>] [--owner <session>] [--note <text>] [--json]` — **v0.4.0 (slice 33)** new verb: append / set / update progress entries deterministically. Writes the canonical structure the OpenRig PROGRESS UI page reads. Replaces hand-editing `PROGRESS.md` with markdown.
- `stage <slice-path> <new-stage> [--mission <name>] [--successor <id>] [--json]` — **v0.4.0 (slice 35)** new verb: set the slice's `stage` frontmatter (wip / provisional / established / canonical / superseded / retired) deterministically. `superseded` REQUIRES `--successor <id>` (rejected otherwise + records the successor); `retired` warns "do not use"; invalid stages rejected with the valid set named.
- `verified <slice-path> --against "<source>" [--mission <name>] [--json]` — **v0.4.0 (slice 35)** new verb: stamp the slice's `verified` line with `verified: <today> against <source>`. `--against` is MANDATORY (bare timestamps rejected — the anti-stale keystone per `conventions/scope-and-versioning` §2). Overwrites the prior verified line.
- `reconcile <slice-path> [--mission <name>] [--json]` — **v0.4.0 (slice 35)** new verb: idempotent repair. Backfills missing `PROGRESS.md`, conforms mandatory frontmatter (`id` / `stage` / `verified`), and repairs id-registration ghosts (`id:null` / doubled-prefix). Safe to re-run.
- `ship <slice-path> <release-mission> [--mission <name>] [--json]` — ship a slice to a release mission (preserves git history).
- `close <slice-path> [--note <text>] [--mission <name>] [--json]` — close a slice (move to `<mission>/closed/`, update status). `--note` is an optional closure note.
- `move <slice-path> <dest-mission> [--mission <name>] [--json]` — move a slice between missions (re-numbers in destination).

`rig scope mission <subcommand>` — mission-tier commands:
- `ls [--json]` — list missions (top-level folders with `README.md`).
- `show <mission> [--json]` — inspect a single mission.
- `create <name> [--template <kind>] [--id <dot-id>] [--title <text>] [--intent <text>] [--depends-on <dot-id...>] [--no-notes] [--json]` — create a mission with an intent-bearing `SPEC.md`, `NOTES.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, and `slices/`. `depends_on` accepts same-project sibling mission dot-IDs and is advisory build-order data. `--no-mission-notes` remains a deprecated alias for `--no-notes`; the old notes-template environment variable remains readable with an advisory.
- `graph <mission> [--json]` — show slice dependency nodes, the current ready/waiting sets, and advisories for malformed, cross-parent, or absent dependencies. Stale edges never block or crash the reader.
- `progress <mission> [--status <state>] [--milestone <text>] [--owner <session>] [--note <text>] [--json]` — **v0.4.0 (slice 33)** new verb: append / set / update progress entries on a mission's `PROGRESS.md` deterministically. UI-valid by construction.
- `stage <mission> <new-stage> [--successor <id>] [--json]` — **v0.4.0 (slice 35)** new verb: set the mission's `stage` frontmatter deterministically. Same enum + `--successor`-required-for-superseded rules as the slice variant.
- `verified <mission> --against "<source>" [--json]` — **v0.4.0 (slice 35)** new verb: stamp the mission's `verified` line. `--against` MANDATORY.
- `reconcile <mission> [--json]` — **v0.4.0 (slice 35)** new verb: idempotent mission-tier repair (backfills `PROGRESS.md`, conforms frontmatter, repairs ghosts).

Convention compliance: `rig scope` together with slice 33 (`PROGRESS.md` + scaffolding) and slice 35 (`stage` / `verified` / `reconcile`) makes `rig scope` the **deterministic enforcer** of `conventions/scope-and-versioning` (§1 dot-IDs, §2 maturity vocabulary). Agents update the convention through commands rather than hand-editing markdown.

### SDLC control plane verbs (v0.4.4)

The conventions these verbs operate live in ONE shipped document: `docs/reference/sdlc-conventions.md` (copied into the assembled CLI package); the operating procedure is the packaged `mission-slice-sop` skill.

- `rig scope slice|mission approve <target> [--scope spec|delivery] [--actor <session>] [--on-behalf-of <human>] [--json]` — the two staged-approval locks, one daemon-side write path. `--scope spec` plan-locks the node's `SPEC.md`; `--scope delivery` (default) is terminal sign-off. Approval is freeze/sign-off, never proven-green.
- `rig proof add <slice-path> --artifact-type <guard|qa|rev1-r1|rev1-r2|adjudication> --verdict <CLEAR|BLOCKING|CONCERNING|PASS|NOT-CLEAR> --candidate-sha <sha> --money-evidence "<line>" [--file <path>|--body <text>] [--evidences <refs>] [--media <refs>] [--self-check <text>] [--json]` — **v0.4.4 (slice 19 FR-8; `--media` via the corrective §3.4)** drop a proof artifact into `<slice>/proof/` with the machine-readable C1 header, validated at drop time (closed sets above). `--evidences` (item text or 1-based index) joins the drop to the slice's `## Proof contract` items — the pairing the Living Notes DELIVERED section renders; `--media` (proof/-relative refs, containment-checked, never absolute) names the curated media the drop stands behind, projected into the DELIVERED items' proof set. Contract/self-check outputs are advisories (exit 0), never gates.
- `rig scope audit <mission> [--json]` — checks C1 headers and the one-SPEC convention (frontmatter `intent:` or a readable legacy Intent section, Mini-requirements, Proof contract, and current NOTES). It never requires a second PRD. All convention findings are advisory/fail-open.

Notes:
- Surface source-verified against `packages/cli/src/commands/scope.ts` at `51554eee` (v0.4.0 post-slice-35); SDLC control-plane verbs source-verified against `scope.ts` / `proof.ts` / `scope-audit.ts` in OPR.0.4.4.23.

## Skill Cascade Audit (v0.4.0)

One top-level command first shipped in v0.4.0 (slice 10 — skill / knowledge lifecycle curation, Hermes-informed). Defined in `packages/cli/src/commands/skill.ts`. Pairs with the daemon-side audit surface at `packages/daemon/src/routes/skills/audit.ts` + `mirror-drift` detection.

### `rig skill`

Usage: `rig skill <subcommand>`

Subcommands:
- `loadout --runtime <claude-code|codex> [--cwd <path>] [--project-root <path>] [--topology <ids>] [--apply] [--json]` — inspect the deterministic managed loadout selected by `catalog.yaml` system selectors, topology/profile selectors, and `project.yaml install.skills`. Reports selector reasons, catalog Git revision/content digest, target, and current/missing/shadowed/conflicting status. `--apply` writes exact bytes plus an ownership manifest, is idempotent, and refuses to overwrite or remove locally modified/unowned content.
- `audit [--json] [--include-cache] [--severity <level>] [--rig <name>]` — read-only audit of the skill cascade. Detects provenance + freshness issues across the canonical → product mirror → hub cwd → installed plugin chain.

Audit categories surfaced:
- **`missing`** — a skill location in the cascade lacks a SKILL.md file but a sibling location has one (declares the cascade-relative gap).
- **`stale`** — a SKILL.md file exists but is older than the canonical or has a content-hash mismatch.
- **`self-referential`** — a SKILL.md provenance pointer references its own location instead of an upstream source.
- **`invalid-date`** — frontmatter `last-verified` / `last-updated` is malformed or in the future.
- **`mirror-drift`** — a downstream mirror copy diverges from canonical with no documented intentional fork.

Notes:
- **Read-only**: the audit does NOT mutate any skill file. Findings are routed back to the lifecycle (curation-steward) for shaped propagation runs.
- **False-green prevention**: when mirror-drift evidence is unavailable for any reason (daemon offline, filesystem inaccessible), the CLI emits a clear `unable-to-audit` outcome with exit code `2` rather than reporting `clean`. This closes the failure mode the v0.3.4 wrap-gate AC-3 almost shipped ("Mirror sync verified via `npm run mirror-skills` clean" — that sync did not touch substrate canonical or hub cwd).
- `--include-cache` includes packaged-installer cache copies in the audit (default skips because those are immutable post-ship).
- `--severity <level>` filters output: `info` (default; everything), `warn` (stale + mirror-drift only), `error` (invalid-date + self-referential only).
- `--rig <name>` narrows the audit to a single rig's embedded skill copies.
- `--json` emits structured findings: `{cascade: [...locations...], findings: [{category, path, evidence, suggested-action}]}`.
- Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` findings present, `2` unable to audit.

Composes with the existing `scripts/mirror-skills.mjs` guardrails — the audit detects what `mirror-skills` would also catch, plus the canonical / hub cwd layers that script doesn't touch.

## Operator Context-Mode Bindings (v0.3.2)

One top-level command first shipped in v0.3.2 as `rig policy`
(release-0.3.2 slice 09), renamed to `rig mode` in 0.5.2 per the PM
ruling RULING-rig-mode-rig-policy-naming (clean rename, no alias —
zero adoption confirmed; `rig policy` is being reintroduced as the
permission-policy verb). Defined in `rigModeCommand`
(`packages/cli/src/commands/rig-mode.ts`). Pairs with the daemon's
typed-primitive store at
`packages/daemon/src/db/migrations/041_rig_policy.ts` (DB artifact
names keep their shipped forms). Operates the operator context-mode
binding surface (sleep / desk / mobile / away / focus / debug) used by
mode-aware agent posture.

### `rig mode`

Usage: `rig mode <subcommand>`

Subcommands:
- `set <mode> [--scope <scope>] [--qualifier <id>] [--<field> ...] [--evidence <citation>] [--confirm] [--bearer <token>] [--json]` — propose a binding. Without `--confirm` the CLI echoes the proposed binding and exits with `exit 2` so scripts cannot accidentally apply; `--confirm` is the explicit operator action. `<scope>` is one of `global_host | rig | workstream | qitem` (defaults to the per-mode recommendation). `--qualifier <id>` is required for `rig | workstream | qitem` scopes and rejected for `global_host`. Per-field tuning flags: `--autonomy-scope`, `--heartbeat-cadence`, `--inspection-depth`, `--update-detail`, `--escalation-threshold`, `--concurrency-limit`, `--permission-prompt-posture` (one of `normal | batch_for_human | do_not_prompt_unless_blocked`; `auto_accept` is FORBIDDEN by convention), `--expiry-or-stale-rule`. `--evidence` carries a free-text operator citation (message id, file pointer, chatroom topic, etc.).
- `show [--json]` — list all operator-context-mode bindings.
- `effective [--rig <id>] [--workstream <id>] [--qitem <id>] [--json]` — resolve the effective mode for a (rig, workstream, qitem) read context. Surfaces `unknown_posture` when no binding matches.
- `cite [--rig <id>] [--workstream <id>] [--qitem <id>]` — emit the short-prose citation line for the effective mode at the read context (per convention §Citation Rules).
- `unset <scope> [qualifier] [--bearer <token>] [--json]` — delete one binding (operator-only).
- `defaults [--json]` — print the recommended per-mode 6×7 field defaults + default-scope mapping + stale rule.

Notes:
- The 6 modes are `sleep | desk | mobile | away | focus | debug`. Bare-word invocation is accepted (`set desk`); `mode:<word>` is the disambiguated prefix form.
- Restate-and-confirm posture (HG-4): `set` is restate-only until `--confirm` is passed. This prevents accidental script application.
- `--qualifier` strict reject for `global_host` (HG-7 guard finding): operators who type `--scope global_host --qualifier <id>` get an error and the daemon is never contacted. The CLI does NOT silently drop the qualifier.
- Operator-edit mutations (`set --confirm`, `unset`) require an operator bearer token (`--bearer` or `OPENRIG_AUTH_BEARER_TOKEN` env).
- Surface source-verified against `packages/cli/src/commands/rig-mode.ts` at `b13a8e4c7` (0.5.2 rename).

### `rig policy`

Usage: `rig policy <subcommand>` — the top-level PERMISSION-POLICY verb, introduced in 0.5.2 after
the context-mode verb moved to `rig mode` (RULING-rig-mode-rig-policy-naming). OpenRig bakes NO
allow/ask/deny permission policy — the harness-native permissions are the control surface. This verb
TEACHES and RECORDS into RigSpec (`permission_policy: builtin:<name> | none`); it never enforces at
runtime.

Subcommands:
- `list [--json]` — the built-in templates (`locked | standard | open | yolo`) plus the reserved
  deliberate-`none` choice, each with its ref form.
- `show <name> [--json]` — one choice: its ref form and what recording it means.
- `current --spec <path> [--json]` — the `permission_policy` value recorded in a rig spec and how it
  classifies (absent = the floor; `none` = deliberate; `builtin:<name>`; custom relative path).
- `apply <name> --spec <path> [--json]` — record the choice into an EXISTING spec via the same
  comment-preserving flow as `rig setup --policy` (which stays as the setup-step composition, not an
  alias). A new install has no spec; nothing is written and the floor holds by absence.

## Commands Not Present

These are not current top-level `rig` commands:
- `rig claim`
- `rig blame`
- `rig replay`

If older docs or habits mention them, treat those references as stale.
